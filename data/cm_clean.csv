My university has a course related to multimedia, file formats and compression that I was really looking forward to take but unfortunately the course will no longer be available by the end of the year. I decided to selfstudy and was wondering if anyone had good resources related to multimedia, fileformats, digitalization and data compression, whether it be books, websites or online lectures/courses, anything would be great as long as it goes deep into the topic and isn't too abstract.

Course title: Multimedia Systems

Objectives: Provides an introduction to standards and formats of multimedia content. We are teaching how to use multimedia content in software applications. Components, architectures and trends of multimedia systems are going to be surveyed.

csMajors,"Alright, I have a dilemma. I have two software engineering internship offers for next summer (likely will be 3 next week, but I'm not counting my eggs till they hatch). I'm really conflicted on which one to choose, so I want to see what you guys think:

Company A:

* Series A startup (growing very fast, recently raised a very big series A from one of the top 4 VC firms)
* $40/hr compensation
* I'll be working remote from home
* Little to no name recognition, at least right now
* It'll be fast-paced work and I'll probably learn/do more
* Not sure on any return offer possibilities

Company B:

* Very large publicly-traded SaaS business ($20b+ market cap)
* $43/hr compensation
* I'll be working in-office
* Really good reputation and name recognition
* Work will likely be much more chill

My main reasoning was because of the class selection and program orientation. There’s a dedicated school of computing at Gtech, which means the wait for classes will be smaller. I also like the specialization system, and the class selection for what I want to go into (physics engine dev / simulation dev) is much better than Michigans. Gtech is ranked higher too.

csMajors,"Hi all, I'm very confused on what direction to take next and would appreciate some advice.

About me: Currently I'm on track to graduate next year. I had an internship at a small non-tech company last year and received an offer from a F500, but still non-tech company this year. I'm still looking for other offers but based on current results I don't expect to get anything better.

Currently I'm considering three options for my future:

\- Interview for new grad positions next year, graduate and start working

\- Graduate next year and do masters

\- Double major to delay graduation by one year

I'm considering the latter two mostly because the current job market is pretty bad and I don't know if I'll be able to get a desirable offer next year. I'm pretty lost at the moment so any advice would be greatly appreciated!",Industry vs Masters vs Double Major?,"Hi all, I'm very confused on what direction to take next and would appreciate some advice.

csMajors,"Hi, I am transferring to a 4 year university in the Spring after recently completing an associates degree in K-12 Education. This degree covered all my basic college classes and about 4 extra education classes. At the university I will transfer to, I am a history major with secondary teaching licensure. I also am a substitute teacher for our local public school system while I am finishing college. I live off campus with my spouse who is in the military and they plan on staying the service for a long time, which means we may have a duty station overseas in our future. 

With my current college degree plans, that would leave my only career options if we end up overseas being a remote teacher or working at a school on the overseas military base through the Department of Defense. These are solid options, but I believe computer science may be a better one for me. 

The cost per credit hour at the university I will attend is $1,039 (Out of state). So I am looking at a good $30k in debt for a history degree (about 2 more years of school) and teaching license. 

**HOWEVER**

This same university I am attending offers a 100 percent online computer science bachelors degree. **The cost? $407 per credit hour (out of state).** Also, nearly all my credits would transfer into the program and I would only have about 2 years of schooling to be done in this program, like the history one. I've always had a deep passion for computers since I was a kid. I know I am fully capable of the workload and intenseness of the degree, when compared to just a history one. Between the potential remote job opportunities in the future with a CS degree - if we end up overseas and the cost of the degree, it seems like a no brainer to me to switch. The only downside is that I will be unable to do any sort of internship, as I need to stay with my spouse and support our family. 

I'm stuck on what to do. I really like history and teaching, but the smarter option all around here seems to be switching to a CS degree. I am looking for peoples opinion on my situation. What do you guys think? Should I switch career paths?

csMajors," I was fortunate enough to receive 3 offers, 2 of which I have narrowed down to - one for Vanguard's Application Development internship and one for Liberty Mutual's StartTech SWE internship. I don't really care too much about the internship pay, I'm more concerned with which company I'll be able to learn more from in terms of technical knowledge and the long term prospects of potentially being a software developer for either company (aka entry level SWE salary).

Liberty Mutual's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$26/hr, have to find housing and transportation to NH office with 3k stipend, great work life balance, full time pay \~$70-100k entry level??? (on the internet it was highly variable), can choose between 7 tech tracks like backend, full stack, etc.

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, housing already provided and near transportation to office, stress-free culture, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???

I'm leaning towards Vanguard just based on the current information, but I couldn't find much information about the actual intern experiences or a constant full time SWE entry level pay for either company, so any advice or past experiences working for either company would be appreciated. Thanks!

csMajors,"So, I applied to a backend engineering apprenticeship at a startup that makes a popular mobile app. It's a pretty decent gig, 40/hr in a LCOL area for 3 months with the possibility of being converted at the end. 

First, they sent me a take home assignment, just creating a basic REST API that handles some JSON data. I turned it in, and got my first technical interview. The interviewer found a bug in my code, and thankfully I was able to fix it on the spot. So they told me I'd move on to the final round (onsite) and I was feeling pretty good at that point.

They sent me the itinerary, and I'll be having a DSA, system design, and OOD interview. Each an hour long. My first though was damn, pretty intense for an entry-level role. 

Thankfully, I have to learn OOD for an upcoming final, so I may have a shot there. I don't do LC though. I might could pull off an easier array or string question but anything more advanced than that and I'm fucked. And I do not know a damn thing about system design...

I'm not trying to come off like I'm complaining. I'm grateful for the opportunity, and I've got another offer lined up in case this doesn't work out. But I do feel like the initial take home (which I did well on) was the most like the actual job would be, so it would suck to lose the opportunity because I can't do LC questions. But hopefully, I can show potential in other areas and still impress them enough to get the offer.","Take home, LC, system design, and OOD interview for entry-level...","So, I applied to a backend engineering apprenticeship at a startup that makes a popular mobile app. It's a pretty decent gig, 40/hr in a LCOL area for 3 months with the possibility of being converted at the end.

csMajors,"So I’m doing a part time internship during the school year atm because I tend to have a lot of free time (spaced out my classes due to having a lot of credits for various reasons, try to spread out difficulty etc as well) and oh my god it’s lovely. It’s at a place I interned previously, and I feel like such a developer! Plus it’s great pay for a part time job (which is, yknow, useful as a broke college student), and I feel like the experience is great. I’m basically just doing dev work as part of one of their teams. Which I know is something you do during a summer internship too, but it’s like- all school year long work experience which I think is super useful and a lot of extra work experience.

And idk it just feels so nice to be doing dev work 🥰. I’m majoring in cs because I love programming so it genuinely is a really enjoyable way to start my day. The work I did over the summer and now is actually used at the company and in production etc and that just feels so great. After my internship over the summer it kinda sucked going back to classes because I really love doing software dev work. I do actually enjoy my classes at university too, but I really like the project work of actual software development/SWE work, and I feel like I learn a lot as an intern as well. So it’s been really nice to start back up doing intern work there (took a while to get through HR so there was a gap at the start of the school year when I wasn’t working). 

Anyway, I know the job market is rough atm (grinding for my summer internship was rough) but there are still places offering part time internships during the school year (this position wasn’t actually posted, my boss just really liked me and wanted me to keep working there, but places do have positions open as well), and it’s definitely something I recommend trying to see if you can continue doing at your summer internship if you live in the area or it was remote. I feel like a lot of people don’t think about it as an option but for me personally it’s been a really great experience!

Also am I the only one who loves feeling so professional and like an actual developer when they work an internship? I’m really looking forward to full time work in the future 

Also as my final side note: this is definitely a reflection of why it’s a good idea to try to do really good work at your internship over the summer (and have good communication and a good relationship with your boss).

Google - Couldn't find a time to schedule after I gave them many options and ended up just rejecting me without ever talking to me even though they asked for a time to schedule

Duolingo - Made it to the final round, got rejected

U.S. Bank - Thought I crushed all the interviews, got a call back from recruiter saying i got rejected

Autodesk - Interviewers really vibed with me, didn't hear anything so i reached back and they closed the position because the org didn't have enough money anymore

Microsoft - Thought I had the best interviews here. Vibed with Interviewers, felt like i gave the right answers. I was refreshing the action center everyday because i really felt like i got it lol - rejected.

Also got rejected from smaller companies / startups as well. Have no idea wtf I'm doing wrong, felt like i was able to do it well last year.

I'm having trouble finding an internship for the upcoming summer, and I want to maximise my chance of getting one, how do I do that? I have school stuff to do too, so I don't have a lot of time and thus I want to spend time doing the thing that gives me maximum return. Possible options:

\- Learn something (elaborated later)

\- Practice a ton of LeetCode stuff

\- Languages in order of proficiency: JavaScript, Python, Java, C

&amp;#x200B;

Now let's come back to my questions. I was thinking learning something like React or SQL or something would be helpful since many of the places I've applied to have been like we need someone who knows SQL stuffs and well react or angular or HTML/CSS etc. would be helpful and not super hard since I know JS and wouldn't have to start from the start yk.

Or maybe I should make some project because companies like those a lot.

Or maybe, considering, I'm trying to find an internship this summer and there is not a lot of time left in that, I should just apply to a shit ton of places and play the numbers game.

I was thinking learning something like React or SQL or something would be helpful since many of the places I've applied to have been like we need someone who knows SQL stuffs and well react or angular or HTML/CSS etc. would be helpful and not super hard since I know JS and wouldn't have to start from the start yk.

Or maybe I should make some project because companies like those a lot.

Or maybe, considering, I'm trying to find an internship this summer and there is not a lot of time left in that, I should just apply to a shit ton of places and play the numbers game.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think?How do I maximize my chances of getting an internship?",hi trouble finding internship upcoming summer maximise chance school stuff lot time thus spend time thing give maximum return possible option apply many place learn something elaborated later practice ton leetcode stuff make project elaborated later ampx200b stuff resumehttpsimgurcomapzw8moy c math major undergrad sophomore u meh gpa project githubcomhttpsgithubcomibzimhtabrepositories nothing special school project language order proficiency javascript python java c ampx200b let come thinking learning something react sql something helpful since many place ive applied need someone sql stuff well react angular htmlcss etc helpful super hard since j wouldnt start start yk maybe make project company lot maybe considering trying find internship summer lot time left apply shit ton place play number game ampx200b thinkhow maximize chance internship
csMajors,"A couple differences are, Optum’s offer is for Irvine and Wells Fargo’s is for the Bay Area, and Optum TDP is a rotational program whereas Wells Fargo TAP isn’t. Optum also has a better TC (~15-20k higher) in a slightly lower COL area, but would require me to relocate for at least a year, which I wouldn’t have to do for Wells Fargo.

The most important factors for me (roughly in this order) are: Growth/Learning Opportunities, TC, WLB, and potential for remote/wfh. I’d also prefer to not have to relocate, but want to make the best choice for my career overall, based on the above factors, and am willing to do so if necessary.   

The plan is to stick around at either place for a couple years then try to jump the ship to a tech company.

csMajors,"I came to university with no knowledge of coding or computers. I never did extracurriculars in high school... I just got good grades, but lots of people have good grades.

I am so behind in my intro CS class. I can't focus because I have been dealing with a lot of personal things outside of school. I am trying my best and working hard yet here I am still trying to learn material we already learned in class a long time ago.

It's so intimidating and stressful and daunting seeing so many people in my class who have already been programming for such a long time. There's so many smart and intelligent and successful freshman already.

And everyone is already preparing and thinking about internships. I really want to get a cool internship one day. I really do.

I know that in order to get these cool internships at Google or Meta or Microsoft or Apple, you HAVE to start preparing and applying as soon as possible. But how am I supposed to do that when I can't even keep up with the intro CS class? I know it's stupid for me to be thinking about internships when I don't even understand recursion when I'm supposed to be analyzing algorithms. But I *have* to think about these things as soon as possible right? If I wanna actually do it?

And there's also having to worry about what extracurriculars to do. What do I spend my time on? What projects do I make? What clubs or organizations or programs am I supposed to join? What competitions do I have to win? When do I start LeetCoding? There's so many things to worry about. There's so many CS clubs at my university and I don't know what I have to look at. But at the same time... how am I supposed to join anything when I have nothing to bring to the table? I'm literally not even doing well in intro to CS... why would any club have use for me?

Everyone seems to be doing all these extracurriculars right at the gate too.

I don't know if my post is coherent at all or makes sense. But... I was honestly just looking for some wise words or advice or any comfort (if I deserve it) from any CS majors on this sub.

csMajors,"Hi guys. So I've been trying to start learning DSA as I have an internship coming up this summer, but I've been really torn between learning Java and Python. Each time I feel like I've settled on one, I keeping telling myself the other might be better. I know there's pros and cons for each, but the main reason I've been thinking about Java is just because there's so many resources.

csMajors,"I completed an interview with a company, financial services company, I attended their summit in August and applied 2 weeks later. I received an OA  3 weeks later and received a super day invitation 7 weeks later. Completed the super day, and I've been waiting and messaged them, and they said they'd have a result by 3 weeks. 

The amount of time this is taking seems a bit suspicious to me, but the super day I had was the best interview experience I had done ever, and had a good impression of the company, out of all my interviews for every year. I feel as if there could be a possibility of rescinding offers even though they're in a stable industry. 

The pay is pretty well 38/hr + $5000 sign-on bonus + 3.3k living bonus. I will have a 1.5 hour each way commuting time. 10-12 weeks Hybrid (1 to 2) days per week. 

I currently have an offer with Fidelity, a company I respect, and has a decent name on this sub as a stepping stone for FAANG. I respect them highly because I applied got a response back after 1 day, and scheduled the next interview for next week. Had the interview the next week, 2 weeks later had the final round, and after the final received an email the day after to schedule a call, and received an offer the day after. I applied to Fidelity in October and they replied so fast so that is extremely respectable. 

The Fidelity offer is not as high, but not that bad either. 37/hr + 3.3 bonus. They are only 1 hour each way. 10 - 12 weeks. Hybrid (3-5days) per 1-2 weeks per month.

csMajors," Hey everyone. I am currently a freshman in college and about to finish my first semester in computer science. However, I’m starting to miss all the hardware related associated with field of computer science, such as the breadboarding, modeling, circuits, soldering, etc. which I love just as much (maybe a bit less) as the software side. My problem is that I know after college there is like a 90% chance I would just go into software anyways with the computer engineering degree, and if thats the case, I would rather pick the major that better prepares me. Was just wondering from any other cse or cs majors thoughts on this, or if my assumption that I’ll just end up in software after computer engineering is wrong.

Epic Systems - 42/hr for 11 weeks, 1k relocations, corporate housing

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer
* Apparently amazing intern program, no archaic tech
* Workplace is cool (campus is amazing)
* Full time comp for area's CoL is great
* Apparently can move onto better places soon

Cons

* Winter in Madison is cold as shit
* Legacy tech, complaints about old middle management
* Full time horror stories and burnouts, lots of negative reviews
* Mostly web development, not many transferrable skills

&amp;#x200B;

BNY Mellon - 48.07/hr for 10 weeks, no reloc or housing (its in NY)

Pros

* Easy to get full time return offer (95%)
* Fintech experience and big bank name
* WLB apparently good for fulltime
* Mediocre intern program

Cons

* No housing, NY rent will kill me
* Apparently can't really boost you into fintech
* Possible use of old tech, depends on project
* Full time comp not great (esp in NY)
* Not particularly organized

&amp;#x200B;

Epic would net me 18480 + 1000 - plane tix

BNY would net me 19228 - about 5-6k in rent

BNY would be a lot less money, but in this economy I just want a solid return offer, which both seem to promise. If anyone knows anything about BNY's START program or Epic's internship and anything about their fulltime and which would be better for my career, please let me know.

csMajors,"I am currently taking an SQL class right now. I thought it was going to be a very easy class, but it turns out it is by far my hardest class of the semester. It makes my data structures class seem like a cake walk. That is not to say that I have put more time into my SQL class than my data structures class, but I just hate writing queries.

That is all it has been so far is writing queries. I feel like I am able to decently visualize things such as data structures and algorithms using real programming languages like C++ and assembly, but I just can't visualize what is going on in SQL.

I will try to watch videos on it, and they do very simple queries (so the videos are useless), while in my class the queries are insane. Every lesson builds on the last, so I am starting to get behind. I somehow got a 100 on the second midterm which is keeping me afloat, and I am sitting at like an 88 right now, but it will surely drop and I am used to getting all A's.

I hate this class so much. Nothing frustrates me as much as SQL. It feels like the language keeps you from doing things that should work. I just want to put my fist through a wall over and over again while doing my assignments. Every question is combinations of  different types of joins, subqueries, window functions, etc, etc... 

I have heard that many jobs will ask complex interview question on SQL. I did some SQL during my internship, but it was mostly just adding or removing stuff to/from tables. Once this course is over I really don't want to even have to consider writing a query again, but it seems that it is a necessary skill. At this point I have practically given up and think I am just going to take the L on my grade. Fuck SQL to hell.

Am I going to be at a major disadvantage?",Am I screwed if I am bad at SQL?,"I am currently taking an SQL class right now.

csMajors,"Hello! So i just today received an internship related to computer science (yay!) but I am now wondering if I should accept it or possibly transfer early.
 So a little backstory. I was originally going to transfer in spring 2024 to a CSU (i go to a community college). Well I found out recently that more classes are required to transfer with an ADT which would increase my time here at community college by a whole year (i have been here for 3 years already and am dying to transfer). I could transfer into fall 2023 potentially to a CSU but that means I wouldn't be able to take the internship. This decision to transfer was made after I applied as I was not aware before. I am not sure if I would get in but I'm hoping I will? I am a local student to both CSUs I applied to and have a 3.9 GPA. 
Should I take an extra semester in community college for the internship? Or just transfer asap. If I choose to transfer I can also get a head start and take some summer classes as well which I like.

However, my goal is to move to the US asap.

Everybody here seems to have much higher GPAs and aren’t getting any internships, so it feels like I’m just fucked. It feels like I’m just gonna end up working another cashier job over the summer instead of gaining actual experience in the field I want to get into. My scholarships run out after next semester, so I was really banking on getting an internship to help pay for school the following semesters. I don’t know what I’m gonna do3.4 GPA",gpa semester might drop 34 b 35 resume submitting internship applying 70 far scared basically screwed internship gotten preinterview thing siriusxm gonna process kotlin barely java python c mysql everybody seems higher gpa internship feel fucked feel gonna end working another cashier job summer instead gaining actual experience field scholarship run next semester banking internship help pay school following semester gonna do34 gpa

So I’m currently nearing the end of my first semester of high school and I’m looking at my college apps and they don’t look too good. 

I’ve always been planning on pursuing a degree in compSci , preferably for robotics, but that might change in the future. 

The dream college I wanted to go to is most likely not going to happen, and the other colleges that are still worth it to go to, but I’d rather stay at home because of the cost benefit and social aspects as I know a lot of friends here. 
My current plan right now is to put just enough effort into school to graduate and focus most of my effort towards study in compSci then getting into a Compsci camp like hack reactor or code smith over the summer but I am not sure of the viability of this plan or if there are better options for me. I’m either planning on using thar code academy to hopefully transfer into my dream college next year, or go into a better job then I would have gotten from going to the collage near home. 

I was wondering if anyone else has tried this plan before or if anyone had any help/critiques, there were willing to provide. Money towards education isn’t a problem for me as thankfully I have parents who can pay.

big question are. Is this possible? Am I rushing into things too quickly? Any resources to help me study compSci? Any alternatives to hack actor or coach Smith that are available online over the summer? What would y’all do?",Career/College help (age:17),"

csMajors,"There’s a news article running today about people not wanting to pay their loans. Several people are profiled. One is getting his Masters in Information Technology and went to Pittsburgh Technical College and Capella University. He’s a Sys Admin. 

Not to downplay the importance of a CS degree or to throw shade at the schools mentioned, but is that seriously how much it should cost?

csMajors,"International student, need help with a decision!

I have two options, and can’t decide! (PS: I have Meta on my resume, so I don’t care about brand name a lot as my resume is attractive enough to recruiters as it is imo.)

1) Series C startup (Gecko Robotics). Quite stable as it’s primarily focused on robotics and so is relatively unaffected by tech layoffs. Small team, great culture. 

TC: 108k base + 8k stock options. 10k signing bonus. Location: Boston, MA


2) Rivian co-op for 8 months, Jan-Aug. Small team again, but I’ll be delaying my graduation until December 2023. Biggest pro is that I’ll get great experience, a chance at a return offer, and will be graduating when things are likely better in the market to hopefully try for better offers.

Pay: $45/hour in Normal, IL + $2.5k/month housing

Also have a third offer for a 6-month co-op from Tesla, but don’t wanna go there.

Very confused! As an international, going for a startup feels risky, but the trade-off I’ll be making if I go for Rivian is a lot of mental calm which comes with having a job lined up. But I also need to realize that I technically only have 3 years left in the US if I don’t get the H-1B, making me going for higher TC straight after grad a more logical choice.

csMajors,"Hi,

So the question kinda covers it I guess. I have applied to close to 100 remote internships, and have even heard back from a few induvial. However, as soon as I tell them I am from South Dakota I am ghosted by these hiring people. It doesn't make sense to me because in the remote section it doesn't say I can't live here. 

It just feels so bad since there is nowhere nearby to work on site since I can't afford to live out of state, and nobody wants to hire a South Dakota resident it seems :( Has anyone experienced something like this or is it just bad luck?",Does what state you live in affect your chances at getting remote internships?,"Hi,

csMajors,"I’m not even trolling, this is actually my situation. 

Quick background / how I “studied”


I started studying February 19th. I started off paying for leetcode premium and trying to learn the basics off of there. I remember making handwritten notes of these basics but I cannot find them. I learned hash tables, stacks, queues, linkedlist, and binary search trees. 

Then, May 14th, I watched one youtube video from a guy with pretty poor beginner advice (ex. Don’t code until you know how to solve the problem, as if you can do an entire technical interview in your head), and structured my studying for the next couple months around his questions.I attempted a leetcode hard the very next day (word search II) and just copied the code once from some youtube video and left the problem. I even left a note saying “I don’t understand”. 

Then, i transitioned into   https://neetcode.io/practice , and attempted problems while using neetcodes youtube videos. I copied code and every time I  copied, i followed these rules:
Rule 1. Don’t write any code until you know how to solve the problem
Draw it out while talking through it in english
Psuedocode
Then code

What ended up happening, on every single coding question, was that i always skipped A and B because you didn’t know how to talk through or psuedocode the problem, and went straight to C, copying down code. 

My comments consist of text straight from the video, but i never really had deep understanding of how to solve the problem, and I didn’t try to solve the problem on my own with no help after i seen the solution. I drew out code on white boards and took pictures of it, put all my code in intellij, but I still never really attempted problems yourself with no help because i never knew how. 

I upgraded the way I approached problems and did it systematically, and this was the system i developed: 

Rule 1. Write down the name of the problem and what the problem is asking for

Rule 2. Draw it out while talking it through in english(use previously written documents steps 2-4)

Rule 3. Pseudocode 

Rule 4. Code. 

Rule 5. View solution and run it in intellij to see if it works. Watch it once and pretend you’re the guy in the video, mock what he’s saying. Then watch it again while coding and making comments. 

Rule 6. Whiteboard

Rule 7.  Answer the final question, “What is one thing I could have known or done that would have made everything else easier?”

Rule 8. Write working code in notebook

Notice how i never attempted the problem myself wit no help. I ran it in intellij to make sure it worked, wrote it on the whiteboard, and then moved on. I never really learned how to solve the problem, i only learned how to copy the answer.


WHAT I THINK I’M DOING WRONG

First things first, my studying is disorganized. I’m pulling from different sources, not writing things down, not writing clear notes, etc. 

I also notice a lack of consistency. I started learning the basics on leetcode, and then never finished any category above 55%(arrays, graphs, hash tables, BST’s). I don’t even know where my handwritten notes are. 

Then, from February 19th, there is a large gap of time where I can’t find evidence that i even attempted to do anything, and then, may 14th, almost three months later, I watch one youtube video from some guy with pretty poor beginner advice, and then attempted a leetcode hard the next day.

Then I spent the next couple months copying problem solutions I didn’t understand in my notebook. 

tl;dr - used YouTube videos I didn’t understand to “study”, and by study, I mean copy solutions without understanding them. I still don’t know how to do a leetcode easy 9 months later. What can I change, what resources can I use, how can I do better?",Can’t even do a leetcode easy after 9 months of studying. Please criticize my study habits?,"I’m not even trolling, this is actually my situation.

My question is that: should I include non-CS related experience on my r​e​s​ume?

Obviously the position have nothing to do with IT, and some people can be a little iffy about the line of work. But I have definitely learned a lot of useful skills that I think can apply to CS such as handling customer satisfaction, following rigorous schedule, and handling stressful situation (especially when dealing with the Cartel members). And tbh, I'm quite proud of it as part of my heritage as well, my grandpa had been smuggling people from Germany and Italy to Argentina since the 1940s.

csMajors," Hello everybody, I´m looking for some help deciding between GM and L3Harris for an internship for next summer.

For context, I´m a junior currently, and am looking to get into software engineering. No matter which of these two I pick, I plan on applying for new grad roles next year in the hopes of landing a more lucrative SWE role at a different company, as neither GM nor L3Harris pays too well.

This means the biggest factor for me is what would look better on my resume when I apply for full-time roles next year.

Details about the offers:

GM:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Warren (Detroit), Michigan. Global Technical Center.
3. Pay: Don't know yet as I have only received the verbal offer thus far. I expect it to be about the same as L3Harris
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~95k

L3Harris:

1. Title: Software Engineering Intern
2. Location: Dallas, Texas
3. Pay: $29/hour, plus $3,000 lump sum housing stipend.
4. Starting TC for full-time role: \~85k--fewer datapoints to go off of.

I don't really know what I'll be working on at either of these two companies either. Just looking for any bits of advice, especially as to which one of these two opportunities would look better on a resume applying to full-time SWE roles at top companies.

I'm currently a Canadian graduating senior in a non-CS major (bio), and for the past 3 years I've been deciding between medical school and software engineering. 2 summers ago I did Microsoft Explore, but reneged on my SWE return offer (yes I know, an absolute MORON move) for this summer as I got a research internship that I thought would help for medical school. Fast forward to this summer and I realized I HATE the idea of the grind associated with medicine, but now I'm fucked because I literally threw away the perfect opportunity to get into big tech.

So, now I'm trying to pivot back into tech and apply for SWE internships for winter 2023 or summer 2023 (which will delay my graduation but probably put me on track for a return NG), or SWE FT (suboptimal as I really wanted an in-person internship), but sadly both of these are pretty difficult.

so we just started learning about amortized analysis (the accounting method and the potenial method) and Im having hard time with this.

1. in effort to try and see more exampples (right now in class we saw only 2 examples for amortized analysis) I found this lect notes:

Im having a bit of problem with 7.6 (example 3-page 4) "" . Now, in a sequence of n increments, a single increment could cost as much as n (actually 2n − 1) ""  
why its actually 2n-1 ? I feel like Im missing ""basic"" stuff here  
if we look at 000  
to flip A\[2\] (the leftmost digit)  
001  
010  
011  
100  
and it took us 4 times  
is it because in the accounting method we consider each inceremnt as cost of 2?  

2. in general the potenial method is a bit ""heavy"" for my understanding, Im having trouble understanding how to know what potenial function to give, I find it a bit hard to find examples online (mostly find the same 3/4 examples in every place)  
if someone has reccomendation where to read/see examples would love to hear(trying to read through clrs, but I feel like I need to see more examples of how to come up with potenial function, especially with O(log n) and O(n\^2)

Submitted app early September, offer mid November

Notes:

OA: For the 90 minute OA, focus on code reusability. The questions build upon each other and you should be copying your methods from one problem to another. Not really leetcode-esque. Keep some sort of note about your OA code either afterward in a doc or just simply recreate it in another editor for reference for the technical interview. I got 34/35 cases

Phone Screen: The phone screen is a broad 30 minute culture fit to see where you fall. Asked about my gaming history and prior work experience. They were  transparent in telling me what teams my skills aligned with. This decision sets up who you’ll be interviewing with for the next rounds. Otherwise they might place you with whoever they think you fit with. 

Technical Round: I think I got lucky for the technical screen. This 60 minute interview goes over your OA answer and asks some basic DSA questions about it. I got sent my OA results from my recruiter which gave me a lot of time to revise my solution, find optimizations, and just understand my own sloppy code to explain to the interviewer. Without this, I don’t think I would have passed this round. This interviewer was a nice Engineering Manager and stayed 20 minutes over to talk about Riot.

Behavioral Round: The first 60 minute values behavioral interview without an engineer was extremely chill. Not the most conversational interview but I only received generic behavioral questions which were easy. Always frame answers in the S.A.O format and try to exemplify Riot’s values when you can. My interviewer really appreciated this. In terms of preparation, I won’t lie I may have gone overkill. I made a doc answering potentially every question I could get asked, why I wanted to intern at riot, etc. It was nice when I could quickly spin up an example that I prepared after being asked a question. Helped me get through a lot of questions.

Hiring manager round: Scheduled for 60 ended in 30. Was critical about my responses which made me fumble my words sometimes. A big focus on Value Alignment. The questions may seem random but they care more about the way you frame your answer than the actual response imo. For example “tell me about a goal of yours”, they care about how you define goals and execute them rather than the actual goal. It’s all about how you think and if that mindset aligns with the team/company. I ran out of questions to ask so instead of fabricating my interest I just thanked them for their time.

Closing thoughts: This whole process is half soft skills and half luck imo. I suck at leetcode and I don't have the strongest technical background. I just did my research on the company, spent time to be able to explain my past experiences, and had some interviewers I clicked with.",Riot Games Interview Process,"posting this bc I wish I had something like this throughout the process.

Hi,
I'm an international prospective student thinking of applying for a Masters in CS in the US &amp; Canada. Looking at the macro economic conditions like Tech layoffs, likely _mild_ recession, the Ukraine conflict, I'm confused as to whether to apply or not.

I'm done with all my exams (GRE/IELTS), documents and everything. I just have to submit my applications and I think I'm getting cold feet.

So, my questions are:

1. What are the intern opportunities in Summer of 24 and beyond? 

2. What would be the state of hiring by 2024-25?

3. Is it worth it to let go of my current SWE job in my home country for pursuing this?

The other option I have is to wait an year out and apply for Fall 2024.

My ultimate goal would be to do as many internships as possible (helping me to understand various fields within tech itself) during my masters and land a good role for FTE.","Fall 2023, is it worth?","

csMajors,"hey everyone, let me preface this with my background: rising junior, 3.8 GPA, go to a top 5 school (uc berk), and i have previous internship experience. i also teach an upper-division class at uni, and i have 4 solid projects on my resume (React web app, generative ML MVG model from scratch w/ python+numpy+pandas+datacleaning, java clone of git, and a computation data/thread parallelism with C)

coding stats: 

1. codesignal 841 (just got this 2 days ago, failed databricks, roblox, zoom, and instabase with 780, so it's too late anyways)
2. solved 89 LC questions w/ distribution 26 easy/57 med/6 hards (finished all non-LC-premium problems on blind 75 except 3 hards) 

i started applying september 29th, and now i have applied to 208 places, received 33 OAs, 12 of which I got a perfect score on. Of which, i only received 3 interviews, and i've failed 1 and only have 2 left. this is my first mistake - applying late september, when the gold was during late july + early august.

i am writing this after failing doordash interview: i know my mistake, and it's just a skill issue - at this point, i am more angry than anything else. i spend many hours thinking over LC questions and talking to people at my school, but i'm not improving at all. i know i'm not improving simply because of my performance - everyone else knows how to solve these simple ass questions, but in that doordash interview, i had 1 question which i understood but could not implement, and i'm kicking myself everyday for it. my classes/sleep are suffering so much. 

tbh, i could care less about what jobs my friends had (so many classmates are going to insane firms), that's not causing me my negative emotions - i'm so angry and disappointed because i am not getting better. i am always missing a little bit, and despite what i do - day by day i'm at the same skill level. i try to put my anger into my studies, and there are days where i sit in the library for 17 hours drinking soylent as my meals trying to grind harder and harder. i don't think i will burn out because im so desparate for improvement - i just keep imagining what it feels like to have a future and that is the biggest motivator of them all, but it is not enough

csMajors,"I can't count how many applications I made... Here's the journey.

Non-CS Eng bachelor (outside of US) =&gt; took CS undergrad fundamentals (non-degree) =&gt; CS MS from 2020.

No internship till May 2022. (I didn't think it seriously because I didn't have experience getting a job in the US and how much it is important to have internship experience for getting a job)

I was supposed to graduate in May 2022. But I failed to get any offer. Summary is

* Application total: 600 (backend, data science, machine learning...new grad that doesn't provide any specific area)
* Internship: Nothing
* Project: one class project
* LC: 250 (easy: 150, medium: 100, hard: 0)
* Codesignal: 842 (I was lucky...)
* Major results: eBay final, Bloomberg final, Adobe final, Lucid (chart) final. MAANG: resume screened. 20\~30 automating OA companies.

Since I didn't have any offers, it was very risky to graduate without any offers. So I deferred my graduation to this Dec 22.

I tried to equip myself with a few things.

* internship: got a start-up internship this summer, and found another internship this fall.
* ground LC: so far 1200 (easy 300, medium: 700, hard: 200)
* learned frontend part (javascript, typescript, swift) and DB (SQL) - did toy projects
* prepared individual projects at least one for the area I apply (frontend, backend, iOS, general NG SWE)
* prepared different versions of my resume: for general, frontend, data science, ML, data engineer

However, the situation dramatically changed... economic recession and I felt it was harsher for international students who required sponsorship (at least, a person who should answer 'yes' to the question 'do you need a sponsorship now or in the future?' although they didn't stick to sponsorship concerning this economic situation). As a result...

* Application total: 1,000 (a little bit more than that... from the time over 400, I didn't count it but set doing it as one of the everyday morning routines. visit LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, Angel.co, RippleMatch, and two or three more)
   * general SWE including backend specific, frontend specific: approx 700
   * data science: 100
   * ML: 100
   * data engineer: 100
   * iOS: 20
* Target position:
   * new grad: 600
   * early career or job description says like this: 400
* Codesignal: 840\~849
* Triplebyte: excellent (DS, Algo, python, javascript), great (react, swift)
* Hackerrank: solved everything with efficient time/space complexity
* Summary:
   * MAANG: ghosted (Microsoft explicitly rejected me)
      * AWS: did phone interview and invited to virtual on-site but pending (unlimited...)
   * Companies I was in the final round in the previous: resume screened (interesting...)
   * Unicorn (or famous tech companies): resume screened
   * As a result, among 1,000 applications =&gt; 10 OAs =&gt; 3 phones =&gt; 2 on-sites =&gt; 1 offer

I guess there are many folks who are actively looking for an offer. Especially for those who inevitably should graduate in Dec with F1 status, I would say  I know how stressful it is...

csMajors,"I’ve sunk at least 80 hours of my time into an advanced data structures/algorithms assignment over the past two weeks and I’ve made no progress at all. My mental health was the worst it’s ever been. I’ve only seen my friends three times in the past year, and I haven’t left my bedroom for anything other than work in months, all my time outside of work has been spent on study. 

I feel so unbelievably burnt out and depressed, and I’m thinking it’s not worth my sanity to continue.

Accenture's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$32/hr, mix of project management + data analysis + coding (highly dependent on project), mixed work life balance (highly dependent on project), culture of ""work hard play hard"", full time pay \~$70-90k entry level???, more well known?

\-$32/hr, mix of project management + data analysis + coding (highly dependent on project), mixed work life balance (highly dependent on project), culture of ""work hard play hard"", full time pay \~$70-90k entry level???, more well known?

&amp;#x200B;

Vanguard's info based on recruiter + internet:

\-$42/hr, more coding focused (based on recent Linkedin users' descriptions), stress-free, culture of ""long term stability"", old legacy code, full time pay \~$80k entry level???, assignments project based

&amp;#x200B;

When I checked Glassdoor and other career review sites, both companies had mixed reviews and a lot of things were highly variable, so any advice or past experiences working for either company would be appreciated. Thanks!

csMajors,"Currently have offers for both companies as a junior in college. Having such a hard time deciding because of remote vs. in-person and company work.

**Appian**

Right off the bat, Appian culture seems impressive. They are an old public company. They flew me out for an explore HQ day, and I felt the company valued developing young talent so they could be prepared in the workplace. The campus is also great, and many employees work at the office daily.

My concerns are the hourly rate, and they seem to be using outdated tech stacks that might limit relevant learning. Furthermore, McLean is not the best location, and the new-grad return salary is lower than industry standards.

**Tanium**

Tanium is an old Unicorn. The company also seems to have great talent and a similarly decent product. It is also private with a distant IPO opportunity, but I am unsure whether it will become public anytime soon.

For Tanium, I am concerned about working remotely as I have worked remotely before, and it was such a bad experience in terms of mentorship and growth. They said I could move near their Emeryville Office, but most of their employees are remote.

My goal for the summer is to grow professionally as much as possible. I have no idea which route I should take. Does anyone have any advice for me? I appreciate you all so much. Comments would be SOOO appreciated.

csMajors,"So in high school I took biology and chemistry, and I graduated in 2020. So whenever I was reading about covid and the vaccines I could relate it to what I was studying. I am currently doing a CS major with an econ minor, and I can relate to my econ minor by reading the news. Is there any way I can read about applications of what I am learning in my CS major, whether it be algorithms and data structures and how they're applied to real life software, or how software design is used in real software? 

Whenever I am studying through my lecture notes or watching a YouTube video explaining a concept, there is always a hypothetical example being given. I get why this is, as most software is confidential and so it would be tough to see how algorithms and everything else is used in them. But there surely has to be a way for there to be more concrete examples of what I am learning. I know the best way to learn is to apply the concepts, which I am trying to do, but I feel like it would severely help my abilities and interests in what I'm doing if I could HOW these concepts are used in things I actually use in real life, akin to how a materials science major would be able to understand the aluminum alloys that build airplanes.

Even though this is my last internship, out of all of the companies I've listed, I'm not sure if I would stay with them if I recieved a return offer. None of their new grad roles look that promising so it's essentially just going to be a one time internship with them during the summer. I just need to figure out what would be the best career move.

I am leaning most towards FS, however, I'm definitely struggling, so here are the arguments for and against each one:

- Full Stack Web Development:
    - Jobs everywhere
    - Remote positions common
    - Skills are ""a mile wide and an inch deep"" (I will be learning Front-end, Back-end, and Middle-ware, which means I will likely not know any of them *well*)
    - Flooded marked - too many web developers (?)
    - Moderately interested (especially for the prospect of remote work)

- Machine Learning
    - Not as many jobs (?)
    - Very abstract
    - Higher earning potential in the long run (?)
    - Less interested
    - Only use Python (pro or con?)

- AR/VR Development
    - Most interested
    - Least prospect of getting a job?

csMajors,"Hi! Hopefully this is allowed. I always found it super helpful to read other people's experiences, so I wanted to share mine :)  !

So I did the New Tech program last summer (if you're a freshman or sophomore I HIGHLY recommend it) and as such, moved directly to final round interviews for MSFT. I finished the program back in early August, and just now interviewed. With hiring freezes and all this tech stuff the folks in the program were really fighting for us, and I'm crazy thankful that they were able to advance all the New Techs to the final round— they really do watch out for the people who do it. But I had my interview yesterday, which went something like this:

11:20: Did a ""sign in"" call, where we went over the logistics of the interview. It was an interview ""day"" so a ton of people went. Seventy plus I think.

1:00: I had my interview! It went great. I spent the majority of it talking about my resume, which my interviewer asked me a ton of questions about. He asked me a lot about my projects and whether I preferred Backend or Frontend work, and I was very honest about preferring backend. We got to the last ten minutes of the interview and I figured that I probably wouldn't get a coding question— but I did! He asked me about semaphores, and I was like ""what are those?"", so he suggested I read about them while he set up the coding question environment. I did and pretty quickly identified that it was a type of multi-threading programming, which I told him. He seemed happy with this answer and asked me to implement a few functions of a semaphore class, which I was able to do pretty quick, and was able to use a few functions present in thread classes, which I knew from a few projects I'd done. He asked me a few more questions and then off I went to my second interview.

2:00: My second interview also went super well. My interviewer and I chatted for a bit and hit it off, then we went into a programming question, where I essentially implemented a Hashmap with an array list. There was some context surrounding it, but that was the main thing. It took me a second to think of a solution, but he seemed pleased with what I did come up with. I asked him a ton of questions about his work, then ended the interview.

csMajors,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm **very** grateful for my position.

**PREFACE:**

I'm a senior in college and have a very safe offer from an automotive company for a LCOL/MCOL living area with \~105k TC.

I've been interview prepping seriously for about half a year, have made tremendous progress, and can do most LC mediums, (excluding unique topics). Though I am getting rusty because I haven't touched LC in a few weeks.

A lot of my applications were simply too late in regard to when I applied. The positions I wanted most which I thought I applied early for ended up getting frozen or are being processed tremendously slowly and look bleak in likely outcome.

The current offer I have is the only offer on my table and I intend to accept it. I was relatively confident in obtaining a higher salary and working for a more modern tech-based company but things just didn't work out that way this year for me it seems, and I'm ok with that knowing I have much time ahead of me.

**QUESTION:**

My question is, where do I go from here? My start date is June and I'll be moving there entirely alone. **My goal is to basically learn as much as I can at this job and double+ my TC very quickly out of the desire to give my family a better lifestyle and retire my folks.**

Do you guys think I should just do a certain amount of leetcode a week/topic review per week to stay comfortable and slowly get better at LC? Do I just apply to new companies for new grad/SDE 1 positions the moment they may possibly reopen next year (FAANG+)? Is there any unique or general advice you feel I would find helpful?

PS. I've looked up all the things I want to do in the area in regard to fitness and socializing, so I will be touching grass.

PSS. I would post this on cscareerquestions but I don't have the karma. :( 

Thank you in advance, everyone!",Not where I thought I'd end up. What now?,"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm **very** grateful for my position.

Hi guys,

I am starting my degree in software engineering in 2023 (a 3-year program), and I have become increasingly interested in the role of a quantitative developer. As such, I have a few questions for current developers about their day-to-day job, as well as questions in relation to the preparation they did to land the role they are in now. Questions are listed below are divided according to these two categories:



Day-to-day

\- Difference being a developer at a prop trading firm vs HFT vs Hedge fund vs Investment bank

\- How varied is your day-to-day challenges? 

\- How much autonomy do you have as a junior?






Preparation 

\- For someone starting a software engineering degree, what would be the best areas to focus on (from reading online it seems like ML is a big emphasis)? I am trying to make a decision as to what I should major in within software engineering 

\- What language would be the best to learn? I have read that C++ is the gold standard in the financial world. 

\- How did you prepare from a finance perspective?

\- Recommendations for resources (courses, books, youtubers). 

\- Recommendations for good projects to do that would sharpen the skillsets you require the most as a quantitative developer

\- How did you divide your time between leetcode problems, projects, courses like algo expert, interview questions, and finance concepts?

&amp;#x200B;

I know this is quite a loaded question but it would be great to get an inside perspective!

Thanks in advance.",Quant Developer,"Quant Developer

csMajors,"So I've seen a lot of posts recently asking how to get good at leetcode. I see countless posts from beginners who don't know how to start and panic at not being able to solve easies despite taking a ds&amp;a course. I see posts from those who have done 200+ questions but still can't reliably solve mediums on their own. As someone who recently went through the journey of going from zero DS&amp;A knowledge to interview-ready in 4 months. I figured I'd write a step-by-step guide of what I did to help everyone out. This post is not intended to be a philosophical discussion on whether leetcode is appropriate for interviews, this will be an actionable guide with concrete steps that you can follow.

**Who am I and why you should listen to me:**

I have to preface this guide with my background so you can trust that I know what I'm talking about. I'm a recent mechanical engineering graduate from a Canadian university who self-studied computer science and web development and landed a software engineer role. Part of this self-study process involved learning DS&amp;A and leetcode which took 4 months by studying 3-4 hours a day, 6 days a week. At the start of my journey, I couldn't even solve easies. After these 4 months, I'm now able to consistently (90% of problems) solve mediums in ~20 minutes and hards in ~35 minutes on my own. I also usually solve OAs (tiktok, SIG, IMC, blackrock, pure storage, c3 ai, cisco, tower research) with 100% test cases, and scored 822 on my one codesignal gca attempt (not the best, ran out of time debugging q3 lol). I've done 6 leetcode questions during onsite interviews and have optimally solved all of them. I'm not trying to flex, just trying to show that what I'm saying is credible.

**My overall strategy:**

As a preface, the goal of this guide is to deeply understand the techniques needed to solve LC problems at an abstract level and implement your abstract solution quickly. My approach is based off how technical material is taught in university courses. What they do is teach a strategy/technique at an abstract level, walk through solving guided example problems using that strategy, have students practice through assignments and practice finals, then apply what you've learned on the actual exams. My overall approach to learning is breadth -&gt; depth -&gt; breadth. First learning what you’ll be learning (breadth), learning those specific topics with a full and deep understanding (depth), then tying the specific topics back into the big picture and how they relate to each other (breadth). I also write summary notes after I read through a topic, I find this lets me take all the information and form a generalized abstraction of the topic along with critical specifics, and if I’m able to write a page of well-structured notes using my own understanding of what I just learned then that means I understand the topic deeply. I also re-read these notes at the end of each of the 4 steps for spaced-repetition effects or when I need to jog my memory since re-reading my own written notes takes me back to the mental state I was in when I first wrote them.

**Step 1: Learn Python (or Java or C++):**

The first step is to get familiar with your programming language of choice. I chose Python and recommend you do the same if you have time, but if you’re in a rush then just use whatever you’re familiar with as long as it’s acceptable in coding interviews (Python, Java, C++). Python is the least verbose language and most similar to plain pseudo code, and in a timed test every minute counts. It lets you spend less time on implementation and more time on figuring out the abstract algorithm which is where the bottleneck is for coding interviews. You need to be familiar with a language before you can learn DS&amp;A so you can concurrently learn the language implementations of data structures and algorithms. To learn Python I just went through the W3 Schools’ guide on syntax and overall language specs (dynamic typing, garbage collection, etc.). The official docs are good as well but they have a lot of stuff that you don’t need for coding interviews. I also took notes on the syntax (6 pages). This step took me 10 hours split across 3 days.

**Step 2: Learn DS&amp;A:**

With DS&amp;A you need to learn how each data structure and algorithm works deeply at an abstract level. For me this meant visualizing a gif of the algorithm in my head, learning the time space complexities of operations the DS/A supports and why they are what they are, learning how the DS/A handles edge cases, and writing an implementation in Python. The resource I used was the interactive ebook PythonDS3 by Runestone Academy. It’s full of word explanations, diagrams, and live code in an editor that you can play around with. It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook’s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook’s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn’t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn’t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.

**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**

So here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you’re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that’s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they’re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it’s by far the best resource I’ve found for this step and the time and energy you’ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can’t afford it then I’ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There’s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they’re pretty succinct and don’t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&amp;A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you’ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you’ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it’s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there’s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there’s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you’re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.

**Step 4: Practice**

At this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&amp;A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy’s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don’t look at the solution until you’re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven’t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn’t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you’ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can’t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it’s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think “what was my algorithm doing at this step again?”. Initially, you’ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I’ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it’s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find “easy-to-understand” and ignore the one liners. If I still don’t understand the algorithm I’ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy’s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don’t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.

**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**

Given how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I’m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I’ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I’ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.

And that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps.

It first explains each DS/A at an abstract level, then shows you the Python implementation. I would go through a page/sub-section, think about the concepts deeply and piece everything together in my head, then write a page of notes on that topic. As a preface, I used Tech Interview Handbook’s study plan to figure out which topics are important and I need to take notes on, and which are not which I would only read. I also used Tech Interview Handbook’s topic-by-topic cheatsheet to confirm time and space complexities and how the DS/A is used in problems. This step took me 6 weeks, and I tried to finish 1 subsection per day. Each subsection only takes 30 minutes to read, but I would reread, think deeply about what I read, google stuff I didn’t understand, sometimes watch a youtube video if I still didn’t understand it fully, and write my summary notes which all took about 3 hours per subsection.

**Step 3: Learn Leetcode techniques/strategies (patterns):**

So here is the most important step that I see a lot of people get wrong. People tend to jump straight into practicing leetcode problems and end up having to do 300+ problems to get interview-ready. The issue with this is that LC problems are designed with particular established strategy in mind, and if you’re trying to learn the strategy from particular problems then that’s very inefficient. This would be like in calculus, trying to learn the chain rule, fundamental theorem, monotonic convergence by jumping into doing calculus practice finals, or in linear algebra, trying to learn matrix operations, finding eigenvalues, or SVD decomposition by jumping into doing linear algebra finals. You can clearly see how inefficient this approach is. Furthermore, many of these strategies came from breakthrough papers in computer science that took PhDs to come up with and have many pages of rigorous proof. Trying to come up with these strategies from scratch or induction from LC problems would require you to be a genius. Now you see why so many people get stuck at this step, they’re doing it completely wrong. The resource I used for this is Grokking the Coding Interview and Grokking Dynamic Programming by Design Gurus and Educative.io (no affiliations). These courses are paid but the information is truly worth the money, as it’s by far the best resource I’ve found for this step and the time and energy you’ll save compared to using other resources is well-worth it. If you really can’t afford it then I’ve heard good things about Leetcode Explore cards. There’s also a Hackernoon article on coding interview patterns that summarizes the patterns taught in Grokking, but they’re pretty succinct and don’t offer the depth of information that I think you need. You could pair that with the CSES Competitive Programmer's Handbook to pick out and learn the specific strategies covered by Grokking. I basically used this the same way as with DS&amp;A. For each pattern, I read the primer, read the solutions to the first few problems, tried to solve a few of the later problems in my head abstractly (5-10 minutes of thinking) using the strategy taught in the first few problems, then read the remaining problems (each pattern has 5-14 example problems). Once I finished a pattern, I would piece together the information into an abstract strategy, the situations in which that strategy can be used, what makes the strategy more/less efficient compared to other options, common characteristics in problems where I should consider this strategy, along with its edge cases and time/space complexity, and write down my page of notes. This is probably the most difficult step of the whole plan as you’ll be flexing your brain for abstract thinking and logical reasoning. It'll likely be very difficult to think that hard but you’ll develop a very strong foundation for solving LC problems later so it’s well-worth the mental pain. I would try to aim for fully learning 1 strategy per day which took anywhere from 3-5 hours and there’s around 24 strategies total (Grokking the Coding Interview + Grokking Dynamic Programming). For dynamic programming, there’s a section in Grokking the Coding Interview but I found it confusing and it only contains 1 DP strategy, so I recommend skipping that one and once you’re done GTCI start Grokking Dynamic Programming which explains that strategy better and also has 5 more strategies.

**Step 4: Practice**

At this step, you should know your Python syntax, understand DS&amp;A, understand the ins and outs of each strategy and should be able to come up with the solution in your head to most LC easy’s in 5 minutes and mediums in 10 minutes. The point of this stage is to actually practice the full problem from prompt to code and practice talking out loud (or whisper if you need to be quiet) like you would in an interview. The resource I recommend is Grind 75 grouped by weeks with 70-100 questions total. Go through each question and try to solve it on leetcode. Don’t look at the solution until you’re stuck for 30 minutes, meaning you haven’t made any progress in your logic for 30 minutes, making logical reasoning steps in your head doesn’t count as being stuck. To actually solve a problem, read the prompt, visuals, examples, and input ranges. Start with a brute force and solve how you would do it intuitively, typically this means start on element 0 and perform steps until you reach a solution. Then make logical deductions based on what you’ve been given in the prompt and how your brute force looks (careful, the brute force might be a red herring to the actual optimized solution). Use your logical deductions and match onto a few potential strategies that you think have a high chance of working and investigate how each of those strategies could be used to solve the problem. Sometimes you'll need to combine strategies in series or parallel. If you can’t identify any, just try each of the 24 strategies one by one in your head, even if this fails it’s all good practice for your logical reasoning skills. You can think of the problem solving process as a graph traversal, where you have your starting state as one node and your goal state as another node. You can add strategies as edges onto your starting node to transform the starting state into a new state. Check if the new state is your goal, if not then add another strategy either onto your new state or your original state and repeat until you reach the goal. Once you have the optimal solution in your head, write down your algorithm in comments above the function in 2-4 lines along with the time and space complexity. Writing the algorithm down takes me a minute, but it saves me 5-10 minutes during my implementation as it lets me focus purely on implementing my algorithm into code by referring to the text when I get confused without having to think “what was my algorithm doing at this step again?”. Initially, you’ll probably be slow at implementing the algorithm in code and run into a bunch of Python syntax errors. I’ve spent hours debugging my code in single questions at the start, it’s normal and just use this to learn the quirks of Python. After implementing, I check over my code once for silly mistakes and then run through it with one of the example test cases line-by-line, keeping all the variables in my head (use comments if needed). Then I submit and fix my code if the submission failed. Once the submission passes I go look at the solution (either official or in the comments), try to find “easy-to-understand” and ignore the one liners. If I still don’t understand the algorithm I’ll watch the Neetcode video for it then try to implement it. After around 20 easy’s I started solving them (getting the first optimized code solution which may have syntax bugs) in 15 minutes. After the first 20 mediums I started solving them in 30 minutes. Hards are usually a combination of strategies and some (mostly greedy algorithms) you just need to memorize but there aren't too many and so I can usually solve them in 40 minutes right from my first hard unless I just don’t know the trick. I did 2-4 problems a day (2-5 hours daily) until I hit 50 problems and that was when I felt confident I could solve 80% of the problems on my own in a reasonable time and the remaining problems if I was given a hint or two which is more than interview-ready.

**Bonus step: Maintain your skills:**

Given how common switching jobs is in SWE due to either increasing TC or layoffs/pip/firing, and how interviews in SWE are bottlenecked by LC problems, it makes sense to try to retain your knowledge such that you only need a week or two to prep the next time you interview. I’m planning on doing 1-2 LC problems per week on Sundays which I feel like after all this prep to build a strong foundation and deeply understand the material should be enough to retain my knowledge. My solving speed will probably drop, but I estimate next time I prep I’ll only need to review my notes and do 30 LC questions to get me interview-ready. This will probably only take 2 weeks time instead of months. 1-2 questions per week will only take 1-2 hours per week which is nothing for the reward you get by staying near interview-ready. I’ll have to try it out to see if this is enough, but it seems like it should be.

And that's the end. If you made it this far, try implementing these steps and let me know how it goes. I hope you find similar success that I have found following these steps.

I have a friend who went to a no-name school for undergrad and also got his MBA from a no-name school. He works at a tech company now making $170k+ doing technical sales (plus commission?). He's only been working a few months and is already making this much. I was looking at his account on LinkedIn and many of his coworkers have similar educational paths. He's also working remotely in a low cost of living area while the position is stationed in a high COL city in California.

I'd personally much prefer to do technical sales since there is a higher degree of personal interaction, and I am extroverted.

csMajors,"Hey all, for the longest I've been considering switching to a career in computer science, specifically in software engineering. My first exposure to coding was in high school. I had a class where we did some HTML and Java, and I really did well at it and enjoyed it. I haven't really touched it much since, but I have fiddled a bit with FreeCodeCamp and looking up code specifically for an application I use which uses Python. I think so far that it would be a good fit for me, but I'm also afraid.

Concerns: 

My current field is accounting and it's too boring. I just deal with monotonous Excel spreadsheets. I'm not really making anything new happen. I don't feel like I'm contributing to anything.

Maybe this isn't a huge issue since there are workarounds, but I find that sitting down too long in general aggravates my piriformis syndrome. It hurts.

Lastly, I'm in it for the high income potential as well. I know accounting isn't a bad field in this regard over the course of the long-term, but I'm in no way interested in obtaining my CPA and working 50+ hours during busy season.

I'm just having doubts. I don't want to invest in another degree only to find that I face the same problems as I currently am, especially now that I'm in my 30's. 

I am considering attending WGU and think that it'll help with the whole work life balance situation for me. 

I actually already signed up, I'm just getting cold feet I guess. I think knowing how to code and having the ability to fix things is cool. Also having more WFH capabilities too. Plus, I want to provide a better life for my child.","About to go back to school for CS, but I'm having cold feet.","Hey all, for the longest I've been considering switching to a career in computer science, specifically in software engineering.

I've actually been quite busy as you can imagine, our new grad position received \~600 applications in 3 days so I've been going through it. Just spent the last 4 hours and went through 3 resumes, since I have to take 45 mins break every hour to play the new Call of Duty (its a medical condition) and also to laugh at the resume details with everyone else in my department (the last resume we threw out, we found the guy's [reddit account](https://www.reddit.com/user/me/) through his email and laughed at his posts and comments too)

csMajors,"So I'm currently a third year math major at Georgia Tech, and I am wondering if it is worth it to double MATH and CS but graduate one year late. For context I studied Data Science at a different uni before transferring to GT, so I plan on doing a masters in Data Science or related after my bachelors. But because of majoring in math my gpa is kinda low so I am wondering if I dont get accepted to any masters program I might as well double major CS and Math and rely on my internships and find a job new grad.

Math + CS minor:

pros:

\-grad on time(4 years total)

cons:

\-not CS major(idk how important major is for internships,jobs,masters programs)

\-low gpa(math classes are hard so less likely to get in a good masters)

&amp;#x200B;

Math + CS major(Double Major):

pros:

\-am CS major

\-more time to get to do research, find more internships, raise GPA

cons:

\-not grad on time(five years, maybe 5 and a half)

\-course load will be much more stressful","Current Math Major, Add on a CS major but Graduate in 5 years?","So I'm currently a third year math major at Georgia Tech, and I am wondering if it is worth it to double MATH and CS but graduate one year late. For context I studied Data Science at a different uni before transferring to GT, so I plan on doing a masters in Data Science or related after my bachelors. But because of majoring in math my gpa is kinda low so I am wondering if I dont get accepted to any masters program I might as well double major CS and Math and rely on my internships and find a job new grad.

Math + CS minor:

pros:

\-grad on time(4 years total)

cons:

\-not CS major(idk how important major is for internships,jobs,masters programs)

\-low gpa(math classes are hard so less likely to get in a good masters)

&amp;#x200B;

Math + CS major(Double Major):

pros:

\-am CS major

\-more time to get to do research, find more internships, raise GPA

cons:

My question is this; when you're this far into a semester, what approach should I have to try to catch up or master this class. Should I start from the very beginning or should I try to redo every sample assignment I struggled with? Should I use other resources?

Hello everyone I've never posted before so I may not know how a couple of things work but I've made a fairly basic BLE sketch where a central connects consecutively with 2 peripherals, checks the rssi with each of them and then writes a value to the characteristic of the one with the most powerful rssi. My problem is that the bleCharacteristic.writeValue() function is not going through at all and to confirm this I made a while loop at the point where the value should be updated on the peripheral and the program stops there which means that the value is never written in the first place. I have tried to change the value with the BLE app from my phone and it works as it should but it doesn't with the central.

Here's the codes for the central.

    #include &lt;ArduinoBLE.h&gt;

Hello everyone I've never posted before so I may not know how a couple of things work but I've made a fairly basic BLE sketch where a central connects consecutively with 2 peripherals, checks the rssi with each of them and then writes a value to the characteristic of the one with the most powerful rssi. My problem is that the bleCharacteristic.writeValue() function is not going through at all and to confirm this I made a while loop at the point where the value should be updated on the peripheral and the program stops there which means that the value is never written in the first place. I have tried to change the value with the BLE app from my phone and it works as it should but it doesn't with the central.

Here's the codes for the central.

Just want to hear some opinions cuz I’m partially unsure on what to doShould I retake codesignal on my second account or submit it on my first one(w 849),applied 2x dropbox sent gca email difference second time applying added two project resume substantial difference project basic resume made google doc second w latex guessing submit 849 email weaker resume probably lower score retake hear opinion cuz partially unsure doshould retake codesignal second account submit onew 849

csMajors,"Background: I'm a sophomore studying CS in college. I go to my state school, and am paying for myself through college. Not super sure on what I want my career to be, but just know I want it to be impactful, ideally medicine.

Situation: I just got offered a scholarship from Boeing, which would cover tuition and housing for the next two years. However, to receive it, I also have to agree to two summer internships (paid) and a 3 year contract after I graduate. I don't really like Boeing as a company—seems like they've failed a bunch—and I've heard their work environment isn't the best either. But, the financial security would mean I can relax for the next two years and wouldn't have to worry about mass applying to internships again. The letter of intent is coming in on Monday, so I don't have all the details yet (including salary, which would obviously play a big role lol), but this is the general situation.

Should I take it? Would 5 years of Boeing look weird on my resume or would it be a good starting point for when I *really* start my career? Is this much security bad?

csMajors,"I'm a sophomore and I think I have good experience. I'd say my resume is fairly good, and I've had it checked by my university career counselor and friends in the industry. 

I do have prior experience (2 short internships in high school, national service/military in my home country where I also did software dev work, and a summer internship after my freshman year). Apart from that, I also have my favorite projects listed. I do have a full stack web app and a mobile app (none of them were class projects).

Apart from that, my GPA is 3.7/4 and I'm a US citizen.

At this point, I've applied to at least 400 jobs (co-ops for Spring and internships for Summer in 2023). I was hoping to at least interview with some top companies (top tech/FAANG companies) for the practice, but I didn't get an OA/interview from any. I did think I had a fair chance though.

I know I started applying late (September), but I know many other students in school who starting applying around the same time and have received offers from companies like Amazon. I've only had 3 interviews, and I was rejected by 1, and I'm waiting on the other 2.

What could I be doing wrong? I thought of a few things

* My resume isn't good. I have posted it on for feedback on this sub and another, but I didn't really get a lot of feedback on the content. My counselor says it's fine too. I do plan on rewriting it to add more details and to try and quantify what I did, but I'll only get to use it when I am applying again next year

Zendesk and Apple will release results next week, kinda curious what y'all think.

Apple IS&amp;T - Partner Solutions and Technology Team: 

Everything I've read online tells me to stay far away from this organisation. The role seems more business-like than coding. Still, the Apple Brand name is really hard to turn away from and the people seem nice.

Zendesk - Productivity Tooling Team:

Great internship programme by all accounts. The projects seem really interesting. The only issue is the uncertainty from the company being acquired. Probably the highest chance of an internship offer being rescinded.

PayPal - Digital Wallets Team:

I'll likely be working on Backend stuff. However, the TC for full-time is less than Apple and Zendesk in my country. Not sure if they'll do layoffs soon.

Morgan Stanley - Cybersecurity Division: 

Incredible internship programme and great tech culture. From what I'm told, they're planning to send the interns to New York for a week which I'm quite excited for. Still, it's a bank, and it's not exactly a SWE internship. 

I'm looking at full-time TC as well, and it seems that for salary: Zendesk &gt; Apple IS&amp;T &gt; PayPal &gt; MS. 

P.S: If it helps, I'm based in Singapore, so I'll be interning in the Singapore branch for the above companies. Would greatly appreciate any thoughts on these internships

csMajors,"The list \[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M'), ('val', 'F'), ('ann', 'F')\] represents the seating arrangement in a circular table. Note that the last person in the list, ann, sits next to john, who is the first person in the list, as the table is circular.

Implement a function called get\_persons(person\_list , n).   

Parameters:

person\_list (type: list): a list of tuples. Each tuple represents a person in the form of (name, gender)

n (type: int): a positive number (at least 2 or more)  This value is the number of people of the opposite gender ""enclosing"" a person p.

We say that john is enclosed by 3 different members of the opposite gender, namely ann, val and alex, as they surround him on both his left and right side. 

We also say that ann is not enclosed by members of the opposite gender, as val, who is of the same gender as ann, sits directly next to her on one of her sides. 

In general, for a person p to be enclosed in the circular table, there must be some members of the opposite gender of p surrounding p on both his/her sides. 

Expected Output:

Test Case 1

get\_persons(\[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M'), ('val', 'F'), ('ann', 'F')\], 2) 

returns \[('john', 'M'), ('alex', 'F'), ('don', 'M')\]. The tuples in the returned list can be in any order.

csMajors,"**Are you an enterprise developer?**

We often come across the term “Enterprise Developers” and even more often, we ask ourselves questions about their profile, from basic demographics to purchasing decisions. But who is an Enterprise Developer? According to SlashData, large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with between 1,000 and 5,000 employees and very large enterprise developers as those who work for organisations with more than 5,000 employees. Non-enterprise developers are those that remain.

**How many enterprise developers are out there? 🤔**

In Q1 2021, SlashData estimated that there are 1.5M enterprise developers working in large organisations, and 2.0M working in very large enterprises. Between Q1 2020 and Q1 2021, there was a 21% year-on-year growth in the large enterprise population, while the very large enterprise population increased by 18%. 📈

This is impressive growth, considering that the non-enterprise population showed only 10% growth over the same period. However, for the large and very large enterprise population, the immediate picture is one of stability: in the last six months, it has remained practically unchanged.

Considering that the biggest tech companies an important proportion of very large enterprises have benefited from the economic situation caused by the pandemic, it is somewhat of a surprise that the very large enterprise population hasn’t increased.Perhaps there is a backlog of hiring splurges that have yet to show up in the data or these companies are remaining cautious and waiting to see how the pandemic plays out before committing to hiring more employees.

csMajors,"Hey all, throwaway for privacy/legal issues. I recently got rejected from a position where I felt that I interviewed very well so I wanted to share/ask some questions.

I'm currently a CS student and was interviewing for a SWE intern position at a pretty big company. I just went through 2 rounds of interviews (after the initial coding screen).

First round they asked 3 questions. 1 Leetcode easy which I solved in &lt;5 minutes (I've seen the question before). 1 Leetcode medium which I got a bit stuck on, but after discussion/explaining my thought process with the engineer, I was able to solve it. The third question was ""just for fun"" (interviewing engineer said usually the 2 questions would take up more time so he's just asking extra questions - this one was more of an open-ended question where I implemented my own class, it sounded like it did everything the interviewer wanted it to do. Left feeling pretty good, but a bit nervous about the trip up on the medium question, but I did end up getting an invite for a 2nd interview.

Second round, they gave me some pre-written code and told me to add some features to it. Everything went pretty well imo, I was able to add every feature that they asked. I even made sure after implementing the feature to run the code and double check with the engineer that it was satisfactory. At no point did I really feel stuck or confused. Again I finished early and the interviewer used that time to ask me about my past experiences. Left this interview feeling super confident.

Fast forward to yesterday, I got an email saying I was rejected. Now, I've been rejected from roles I really want before, so I'm not particularly new to rejections, but for every single one of those, I've left the interview feeling unsure/bad about my performance - usually because I didn't finish or didn't account for all edge cases. But not for this one, I left every interview feeling pretty good, because after all, I solved all their questions, usually this was enough. This one stung a bit more than usual because it was an interview that I felt very very confident about - at no point did the interviewers indicated to me that they were unhappy with my solution or that my solution was wrong or even suboptimal, I was completely under the impression that I did very well. Now perhaps that is on me for being too confident, but to the fact that the interviewer seemed happy with my answer + ending the technical portion early/asking an extra question gave me the feeling that it went well.

My question now is is it worth it to reach out to my interviewer and ask what I did wrong/how I can improve. Another question of mine is that is it possible that my 1st interview was what caused me to get rejected? I was under the impression that if I did poorly on my first interview, they wouldn't schedule a 2nd interview - and the Leetcode med on the first interview was the only question I got semi-stuck on. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

TLDR: felt that I did really well on both interviews, got rejected, kinda salty because I didn't feel that the feedback the interviewer gave during the interviewer was indicative of the result.",Rejected from internship - quite surprised,"Hey all, throwaway for privacy/legal issues.

In the first interview, I demoed a project that was somewhat complex but mainly had a high-quality codebase (complete with unit tests, documentation, etc.). I also talked about how it was one of my first projects with the language of choice (again, showing a love of learning).

I have heard the return offer for my internship would be around 75k and the median for levels reflects that salary for entry level.

* **Application Development** builds proficiency in application development for business systems. Languages include Java, C#, and Ruby.
* **Database Management** will provide you with a highly developed skill set focused on daily operation of relational databases, system administration, backup and recovery, advanced SQL, and data warehousing.
* **Network Management** will give you the skills needed for network administration, security and disaster recovery, platform integration, and Windows and Unix servers. Some courses are integrated with established programs such as the Cisco Networking Academy Program.
* **Web Development** will provide you with the specialized skills you need to develop content for the Web, including server-side technologies, introductory Internet security, platform integration, and mobile technologies.

1. Full Stack Web Development. After completing the Full-Stack Web Development Diploma students will be able to design, create, and modify a suite of web applications and provide front end and back end development support on development for web applications. Graduates will demonstrate proven experience in the back end and the front end systems.
2. IT Operations. IT Operations teams define how an organization manages software, hardware, and cloud services. They provide other IT support such as network administration, storage, information security, device management, cloud management and help/service desks.  
3. Data Science and Machine Learning(with coop).Study the fundamental concepts in mathematics and statistics that make these technologies possible.

* Gain the skills to collect / organize data and use analytics to inform decisions.
* Implement current machine learning algorithms to address common needs in industry.
* Develop the skills to effectively communicate technical ideas with other developers as well as those without technical knowledge.
* Experience working with industry to develop code for real applications in data science and machine learning.",Transfring to CS.

Zendesk hasn't released the result yet, but I am curious what people think.

Arista: They seem to be doing well as they have not laid off anyone yet (afaik), and they intend to convert all successful interns to full-time. Internship is on-site. They build software involving network. 4.8 stars review on Glassdoor from previous SWE interns. 

Zendesk: They laid off 5% of employees 3 days ago. Is going through an acquisition right now. Compensation is getting gut left &amp; right and recharge Friday will be no more.

For example, one asks for some backend skills, the other for some frontend skills like HTML/CSS.

csMajors,"I was at a restaurant a while back and this woman was sitting next to me. I was by myself (IDGAF about eating by myself because I'm not some normie) and this woman started bragging about how much money she made as a realtor last year. A few minutes later, she put down her phone and started glancing at the menu.

Without skipping a beat, I decided to pull my phone out and pretended I was having a conversation. I said how I was sitting next to this realtor who didn't know know her job was going to be replaced by an iPhone app within the decade, and how people could by houses from their smartphones pretty soon. Honestly, I hate people who brag about money. It fucking pisses me off. It made me think about the people in California who struggle to buy houses because of the real estate market. She kinda looked over with a puzzled expression on her face. Her husband came back from the restroom and she explained what happened and he confronted me.

We kinda got into it because I said his wife is more than capable of standing up for herself. He kind of embarassed himself because he was raising his voice while I was stoic and calm. Marcus Aurelius.

Anyways, the next week I had my last rounds of interviews at the Goog. Guess who it was. We went through the interview normally and he gave me the hardest fucking leetcode question. He asked me to program in front of him instead of writing down my solution on the whiteboard and I used the name of the restaurant as one of the temp variables lol. 

Today, they told me I didn't get the position. Gee, I wonder why?

I have reason to believe he didn't hire me because of our previous altercation. Can I hire a lawyer for discrimination? When he saw me, he immediately should have gotten another interviewer because he's inherently biased.

Anyways, I'm not to worried about it. I had an internship at another FANG and when I get that I'll be making 150k easily there.",any way i could salvage this? i accidentally insulted my interviewer's wife,"I was at a restaurant a while back and this woman was sitting next to me.

csMajors," I am 35yo, have been out of a job for 2 years. I am in the US now doing a Ms in CS. I have a undegrad degree in Engineering of which I used for only 1 year as an electrical engineer, after which I switched career to manufacturing in a non-tech related supplier facing role. I have been getting huge setback in getting internships for summer 2023, which is required for this degree. Every other coursemate around me is at least getting some call backs, even those with less tech experience than me, whether it be in skills or tech work experience.

I know networking is important for someone my age, but I have none. I am so busy trying to catch up with the others in tech skills that I don't have much time to network. I tried to connect with people through Linkedln and such. Again, I feel extremely insecure because of my age and non-experience which is unusual for people of my age. Maybe recruiters just don't know how to put me in a box. I am neither young nor experienced.

What else can I do?  I thought the fact that I got admitted to this Ms program means I might stand a chance to break into tech but I am not sure if the school is just a scam now lol.

Ps. I am trying to specialize in Java, and developing portfolio that incorporates other stacks, React, CSS, cloud, Python etc. Still building my portfolio.

csMajors,"I’ve recieved offers for both Cvent and JP Morgan for a Summer 2023 internship.

Cvent is nice because they pay $45/hour and they have a high return rate percentage. The internship is also remote. However, Cvent is not as well known and I’m not sure if they are considered a tech company but they are in the event management field. 

JP Morgan offers a pay of $39/hour but   its not remote so I have to pay for housing, although they give me a stipend that covers most of it. Despite the lower pay, I believe JP Morgan is more well known and looks better on a resume for new grad.

I have to pick a focus for my final project and I’m struggling to think of something.

csMajors,"this is for the role of backend engineering intern (summer 2023)

i have previously passed the first technical interview two weeks ago, and have an interview scheduled for next week. today the recruiter has reached out to me saying that they are cancelling my interview as they are only considering candidates graduating in 2024 or earlier (i’m graduating in 2025). then the recruiter asked if i’m interested in backend roles with other teams at tiktok, and if so, she will help me with matching with other teams. i said yes and thanked her for her help.

just wondering as this is my first internship hunt, is this a common scenario? and will this likely end up in a rejection if no team is found suitable for me? i’m also worried because it’ll definitely push my second interview even later and i’m not sure if they’re wrapping up hiring soon.

i’m a sophomore with no internship experience and this is the only internship application that’s been going well for me so far, so i’m really nervous and also a little sad.

* More resume value (I think)
* Big intern class

Cons

* The org im placed in doesn't sound interesting (potentially boring intern project?)
* Lower pay (\~$45/hr)
* Have to be in redmond 

**Atlassian:**

Pros

* Enjoyed from interviewers to recruiter seems really cool
* Product(s) seem a bit more interesting 
* Higher pay ($60/hr)
* In SF or NYC

Cons

csMajors,"I love coding and I have fun doing it, something that I'm sure EVERYONE has said once they enrolled in their Intro class. 

Regardless, I am falling behind. I'm not confident in myself and my programming. In my class, we have 2 major exams and the final. I got the lowest score in my class on that first exam and going over it with my professor, it was little mistakes that I had no right making. If I had read the questions a bit more carefully, I could have gotten a C or B-. I scored full scores on the coding part, but it was the multiple choice questions that killed me. 

I'm not confident, and I'm afraid that I'm going to fail my class. I don't want to blame it all on the professor, but I had last pickings for my classes, and he has a 2.3 on RateMyProfessor. 

I need advice on how to study/practice for this class. I'm a month away from my final, and about 2-3 weeks away from the 2nd exam. I keep losing motivation. I guess I just need some encouragement. Retaking this class is the LAST thing I want to do, simply because it'd be embarrassing for me. I know that there are SEs out there who got a C in their Intro class, but that isn't enough to calm my nerves. I want to be successful in this class, and in my future with CS.

csMajors,"Some weeks ago, I posted a few questions about Adobe's OA and interviews. I got an offer for a Software Engineer Intern Summer 2023 and I would like to share how the process went starting from my initial application.  


Step 1: Polish up your resume, make it as specific to the role you like as possible because managers review the resumes of people they'd like on their team, so be as specific as possible.  


Step 2: Stalk the Adobe career page for internships and apply at the earliest date possible.   


Step 3: This is the hardest part. If your resume is selected, you will get an online assessment. It's hackerank. 3 leetcode style questions generally.  


Step 4: If you pass the OA, Your resume is reviewed again, and they perform team matching. You will be invited to the Interview Forum where you can have as much as 4 interviews on the same day. You are essentially being matched with different teams. It can be less than 4. I had just 2 interviews with different teams. They mostly talk about your past experiences and ask you basic CS questions depending on your experience.  


Step 5: You get sent a form to fill specifying the team you liked speaking with the most in order of preference, If the Hiring manager likes you, an offer would be extended.   


Note that at Step 4, you already almost guaranteed an offer, so be confident and be calm.   
Also, Adobe hires on a rolling basis, so you can always re-apply if your initial application is taking a long time.

Its usually 10$/month but as a student you can use your school email and proof of enrollment to get it for free!!

csMajors,"Hello, I am currently a senior at a state school who will graduate next semester. I hold a 3.71 GPA, but I am having a lot of trouble in my Machine Learning class. I feel like I just bombed a project that was worth 20% of our grade, and I will probably end up passing the class with a C. 

Am I better off dropping the class (which would mean I would have to make up the credits over the summer / take an additional 3 credits next semester to graduate on time) or just riding it out and taking the low grade?

For my first SWE Intern interview invitation, I was super shocked and unprepared when I got invited to a phone interview and then a technical interview because I applied and forgot about it. I didn't expect a response. I didn't even remember I applied. Since this was my first technical interview, I completely bombed it.

I've applied to about 40 internships so far, with 10 rejections and waiting for 30 responses. I recently got an invitation to interview for a startup company as a Frontend Software Engineer Intern, quite literally my dream job title. The position is remote and has flexible hours, but it's **unpaid**.

I currently work part-time during school, and working two jobs, where one isn't paid, doesn't sound very fun. I also don't know if my current job would allow me to do the internship. However, this would be *relevant* experience I can put on my resume.

Summer 2023 is far away, so I don't think I should set this internship in stone because I could get another internship that's actually paid. But I'm scared I'll get no offers. Working for free is something I *hate* doing, but I'm afraid if I reject it and I get no offers, I'm screwed.

What's worse is the job posting didn't specify *when* the internship starts and ends. Just that it's unpaid and remote.

csMajors,"Hi guys,

From SoCal (San Diego).

So basically, I attended CC for a couple years swapped majors a couple times (bio —&gt; jazz performance/MTech) all whilst having zero drive/feeling purposeless and was also going through some rough stuff at the time and that culminated in a really poor gpa. 

I took a gap year and worked a couple jobs while self learning how to code and really fell in love with it. At the tail end of that time period, I decided to meet with a counselor at the CC and create a plan. I decided to start off slow and do well to build my confidence back up and progressively increase difficultly as the semesters have passed. 

Well, It’s been a bit over a year and I wouldn’t even be able to recognize myself from 3 years ago. I’ve had straight A’s, love the material, and have really good relationships with all my profs too. 

So here’s the deal, I can’t stop worrying about competitiveness and I get super stressed and angry with myself because I calculated that even if I get straight A’s till I transfer, I can only climb up to a 3.4 (even with acad. renewal). I even have all my easy GE courses out of the way in addition to some other major specific coursework(the ones I did poorly on (lots of B’s and C’s) so now I’m left with all the tough CS major prep coursework to take simultaneously. 

Currently, it’s not too bad. I’m taking Calc, Java II, and Discrete (expecting 4.0) but worried for next semester. Ok I’m very worried. Im taking Calc II, C++ II, Data Structures, and Physics. Idk if it’s just me who this terrifies but yes I am terrified. The kicker is if I change my schedule or pace financial aide office said I lose my aide so yeah. My next and final semester I’m taking Physics II, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 

I just feel like my stress of trying to get A’s every semester to bring up my GPA is driving me nuts at this point and only see things getting harder just before I can apply. 

I will be finished with coursework by end of fall next year which leaves me spring semester to work on some fun personal projects/ apply for internships or something? Also not sure if they’d make it onto the application if I apply early. 

Is there any way college admissions officers would see the big difference on my transcript between now and before I returned or maybe see my major prep coursework gpa vs GE gpa?? 

Which universities would you guys recommend I apply to given the situation and (fingers-crossed) 3.4 gpa?  (I have researched averages for accepted transfer GPAs into CS in CA but would still like opinions) 

Pls let me know if you guys have any advice, motivation, study tips for the courses I mentioned, really anything. I feel like while I am looking for advice, I’m also kinda venting while I’m stressed out studying for a Discrete midterm. 

Please feel free to comment in a casual way if you don’t feel like providing any constructive info or even vent yourself about your own experiences. Just talking with people would be nice right now.

Idk if it’s just me who this terrifies but yes I am terrified. The kicker is if I change my schedule or pace financial aide office said I lose my aide so yeah. My next and final semester I’m taking Physics II, Linear Algebra, and Differential Equations. 

I just feel like my stress of trying to get A’s every semester to bring up my GPA is driving me nuts at this point and only see things getting harder just before I can apply. 

I will be finished with coursework by end of fall next year which leaves me spring semester to work on some fun personal projects/ apply for internships or something? Also not sure if they’d make it onto the application if I apply early. 

Is there any way college admissions officers would see the big difference on my transcript between now and before I returned or maybe see my major prep coursework gpa vs GE gpa?? 

Which universities would you guys recommend I apply to given the situation and (fingers-crossed) 3.4 gpa?  (I have researched averages for accepted transfer GPAs into CS in CA but would still like opinions) 

Pls let me know if you guys have any advice, motivation, study tips for the courses I mentioned, really anything. I feel like while I am looking for advice, I’m also kinda venting while I’m stressed out studying for a Discrete midterm. 

Please feel free to comment in a casual way if you don’t feel like providing any constructive info or even vent yourself about your own experiences. Just talking with people would be nice right now.

I’m deciding on whether to accept my offer from Cigna or Emerson, and I’m also currently in the interview process with Dick’s Sporting Goods (Not sure where that’s going, hopeful tho). 

The pay is roughly the same, and this’d be my first internship. All companies give me the flexibility to work within my location, and I liked everyone I’ve talked to at these companies so far. I’m having a hard time deciding, and if DSG were to extend an offer, it’d make me even more uncertain.

Advice:

to start this off I should probably note that I didn’t have any technical experience coming into college, I was actually gonna major in something like econ or psychology idk. When I decided to make the switch to CS, I was that one dweeb in all my classes who literally felt behind in everything. So you may ask how did I make the progress to where I am now?

the answer to this question is very simple: Leetcode, Leetcode, Leetcode

Let me repeat that again: Leetcode,Leetcode, Leetcode. 


that’s it, simple. keep your head down and focus on leetcode, and it will 99% guarentee you success. now the salty ones will complain and state that because I go to a T10 CS school, I just had an automatic advantage. Idk how else to debunk this other than the fact that my resume in freshman/sophomore year was absolute dog shit. every recruiter I talked to back then advised that I apply for more “business centered roles”. I ignored all of them and just grinded leetcode. the one company that gave me a chance with just an interview was my golden ticket. I knocked all the rounds out of the park because of LEETCODE. I kept my head down and grinded that shit hard until I was given a chance. 

I would say after getting the first internship on the resume it helped a shit ton. from there it became pretty easy to atleast get an interview. my advice for those struggling to get any opportunities right now would be to just put your head down and grind leetcode, that’s it. when this stupid recession is “over”, focus then heavily on the networking and applying. (Note: obviously still apply to jobs now, but make sure to focus on leetcode more imo). to be best prepared after the recession is over, I would want to be a leetcode god. 

that’s it. good luck everyone 👋

A salary of $100k in Houston is worth $208k in San Francisco. 

What benefit is there to earning a $200k salary in the bay/NYC when earning a $100k salary in a MCOL city is just as good?

csMajors,"I'm currently deciding between Stripe and Salesforce SWE internships. I'm a 3rd year right now, but I plan on rerecruiting for a full time just because I'm not necessarily that interested in what either of these companies are doing. Given this year's job market, I think I might have to just go with one of these companies instead of waiting for a company I'm more interested to get back to me. My dream companies would be something along the lines of Snapchat, Spotify, Pinterest, etc (more user facing companies if that makes sense?). Here are the pros and cons of each internship from my perspective, and I would love to hear what anyone else has to say about this.

After housing and benefits are added up, both internships pay just about the same, so that's not the biggest deal to me. 

**Stripe**

Pros: 

* Seems to be a bit more of a prestigious internship so it might add more value to my resume? Correct me if I'm wrong
* Company provides food and more benefits
* Work is more engaging and interesting

Cons:

* Low possibility of a return offer (I heard barely anyone from last year's Stripe intern class got return offers) and considering all the new layoffs, I definitely don't know what the situation will be like this year
* Bad work-life balance, which is something that is very important to me but as long as I'm not working over the typical 9-5, I think I would be okay with it

**Salesforce**

Pros:

* Great work life balance and employees love the company
* More stability that Stripe, much higher chance of a return offer

Cons:

* Adds less value to my resume? Please correct me if I'm wrong
* The work I do is more boring and obselete, at least that's what people tell me.

csMajors,"I’ve been getting ALOT of dm’s about my experience interviewing for TPM so I’m making a post so everyone can have their questions answered in one place. 

I had no coding questions but I heard that some people did. Honestly it was good. My interviewers were friendly. Most of the time was focused on purely behavioral/ hypothetical questions but it’s not that simple. For instance, I own a small business. One of my behavioral q’s was “tell me about a time you were able to simplify a process” so I talked about how I created a subscription model to eliminate a checkout process for my customers. They dug into that with follow up questions like “How did you land on a subscription model? Did you try out other things first? How did you manage the timeline of rolling out the subscription model? Did you end up prioritizing/deprioritizing certain products/initiatives? if so, how did you decide what to prioritize/deprioritize.. Okay lets walk through a hypothetical. Imagine you’re a PM and there is a problem that can be solved with a specific software. You have two options, buy the software from a 3rd party company or develop the software internally. What would you choose for a short term solution and why? what would you choose for a medium term solution and why? How would you pitch that solution to leadership? What are the 3 most important factors when considering going with a certain solution? (My answer was time, cost, and impact) Everything is structured like a fluid conversation. Resume review questions /behavioral questions end up blending together most of the time. I had 2 product design questions in the last interview of the loop but it wasn’t your typical “design a clock for a blind person”. On one of them I didnt even realize it was a product design question until part way through. They asked me my favorite microsoft product and after I answered, they asked a bunch of follow up questions that mirror those in product design questions and thats when I realized lol so I immediately pivoted and started using a product design framework.

csMajors,"Hey everyone - 

So long story short, I'm a computer science master's student with working experience. After my undergrad, I did a IT Rotational Program where they barely let me touch code. I did a bit of frontend programming and some bash. Now, my full-time role is a scrum master and I hate it. Not going to get in all the details of why, but I'd rather be hands-on. 

When I apply for the new grad SWE roles, I'm usually told they do not take master's students or that they will not take me because I did not do my master's straight after undergrad. 

Then I was told to apply for associate roles, which has been a nightmare of it's own, because I'm competing with people who probably have years of software development experience. 

Now, I'm being told to just work as a scrum master in another company by family/friends, but.. it's just not for me. Any tips on how I can get into a software development role?",Not getting a job,"Hey everyone - 

So long story short, I'm a computer science master's student with working experience. After my undergrad, I did a IT Rotational Program where they barely let me touch code. I did a bit of frontend programming and some bash. Now, my full-time role is a scrum master and I hate it. Not going to get in all the details of why, but I'd rather be hands-on.

My profile/resume: I’m a CIS major at a no-name state school. I own a small business and had a sophomore year internship as a technology consulting intern at a well known firm working under a product owner and a tpm. 

The interviews:
Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: Did assessment and hirevue. Hirevue was all behavioral and product sense. Ghosted. 

Jane Street Business Dev: I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for a Business Dev analyst. I completed the take-home but I withdrew after the resume screen because I wasn’t interested in the role. I have no information on final interviews.

Palantir Deployment Strategist: I withdrew after the phone round due to me deciding the role wasnt for me after some research. I also was turned off by the length of their recruitment process. I have no information on final interviews.

Manstercard PM: Their final interviews were mostly behavioral with a few technical questions about the agile software dev process. There was no coding. They dug into my resume. The interviewers were dull and the pay was abysmal. I declined their offer. 

Oracle PM: this one was weird. I applied for Pm but the recruiter tried to push me through to interviews for a security engineer. I have zero experience in cybersecurity so I asked to be placed back on the Pm track and she agreed. The phone screen seemed rushed. It was ALL behavioral. I was ghosted after phone screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Expedia PM: I completed the assessment and Hirvue. Hirevue was behavioral and product sense questions. Final interview was behavioral and technical questions (no coding) and a mini case study that was basically a product design question. I got an offer. I’m declining it.

Walmart PM: I completed a personality assessment and passed. Final interviews were behavioral and product sense/design. No coding. I’m declining the offer.

“That” FAANG Business Intelligence Engineer: Final interviews were half behavioral half technical. Hit hard on your LP’s. They also asked easy/medium SQL questions and basic statistics questions. I was rejected after final round.

“That” FAANG again Program Manager: All behavioral and resume review. Like intense resume review. Again hit hard on LP’s. I got an offer. I’m declining.

Google APM: Rejected after resume screen. I have no information on final interviews. 

Google Bold: Received candidate questionnaire but haven’t heard from them since. I have no information on final interviews. 

Microsoft Customer Success: All behavioral and Analytical questions with an intense resume review. This is a customer facing role so much sure all of your answers are customer focused. I declined the offer.

Microsoft TPM: Mostly behavioral and resume review with some analytical and product design/ product sense questions. Use exponent/ cracking the PM to prepare.

JP Morgan Chase (Palo Alto, CA)

pros: 

1. might be a stable option when it comes to this recession/tech layoffs + big bank cushion 
2. i'm familiar with bay area/location so wouldn't be that hard of a transition 
3. recognized name

cons:

1. have to find my own housing (they do give a 2.5k sign-on) 
2. unsure if the projects or work life balance will be exciting - i'm thinking banks are more bureaucratic 

&amp;#x200B;

Expedia (Seattle)

pros:

1. love the location and the campus, totally see myself there. 
2. seems to have more exciting projects
3. less tax + corporate housing provided

cons:

1. i'm from ca so moving to seattle is new (looking forward to it tho)

csMajors,"Hi ladies and gentleman ,

So I just receive an email from one of the FAANG  companies about a OA for a Software Development Engineer Internship. I wanted to know the type of questions they might ask!

These are the 3 general ideas of what they might ask but I want to know how to prepare for it as it's one of the FAANG companies. 

1. **Work simulation:** \~45 minutes. You'll work through scenarios like those commonly experienced by \*\*\*\*\*\* Support Engineers.
2. **Technical Knowledge**: \~ 25 minutes. You’ll answer a series of questions to help us understand your technical knowledge.
3. **Work preferences &amp; skills**: \~ 10 minutes. You'll answer questions to give us a better sense of your work preferences and technical proficiency.

I'm really nervous to take it as it's 80 minutes(which I'm not complaining) as it seems like their might be a lot of questions! I just want to be as prepared as possible for something like this !

csMajors,"Freshman in CS here. I've been reading quite a few posts recently from r/cscareerquestions and this sub. With all the layoffs from big tech and market corrections to tech making it so that VC is harder to come by, it caused less open positions than last year (I think, corrct me if I am wrong). I was hoping this tech recession would be done by the time I graduate, but I'm seeing some of you say that it's gonna last 5+ years before it gets better. Some of you are acting like getting a internship let alone a job is a herculean effort only achievable by the beat and brightest.

Am I fucked? The competition has been increasing a lot in recent years, and the number of CS grads has only risen dramatically. I know the demand for skilled engineers is still much higher than supply, but the market for juniors is abysmal I heard, at least for big tech. If it's also abysmal for regular ass joe companies according to this sub then god help me. People are saying that tech is still the best field to get into, although I am starting to have doubts about that. 

If this is better than other white collar fields, then those fields are swimming in the pits of hell.

csMajors,"Hi everyone,

Clearly lots of companies are sinking right now, especially with big tech. Things are pretty unfortunate, especially for people who've interned at top companies and were looking for return offers.

Lots of people, even those with tons of top-tier internships, are having trouble landing jobs because so few large firms are hiring.

I was doing some research into Unicorns (private companies worth over $1 Billion), and I realized that lots of Unicorns that we talk about on this Subreddit (Databricks, Stripe, Scale AI), are pretty well known and competitive, but I saw that there were a ton more Unicorns that people just haven't heard of, but have valuations just as high.

I thought that this was a simple thing to build, so I scraped some data and built a simple website to help people find a list of Unicorns given the area that they're interested in.

It turns out that there's companies like Miro, GoodLeap, and Talkdesk, all of which are Software Unicorns with valuations of at least $10 Billion.

csMajors,"Hello! Looking for some opinions on this. I have a FAANG Vancouver intern offer and an Okta Toronto intern offer. TC is exactly the same. Thinking more about which one would lead to better full-time opportunities, either in terms of looking better on the resume or likelihood of getting a return offer. Would love to just return to where I intern and not have to go through recruiting all over again next year.

Okta pros:

* In Toronto, way closer to home. Don't mind relocating for the summer but would want return offers in Toronto. My other offer is in Vancouver, and I'm worried return offers would be in Vancouver too.
* Seems to have a good culture (at least better than the alternative)
* Way longer and more professional 4-round interview process. Whereas the other offer had one round after OA, interviewer didn't show up first time, and very robotic communications.
* Hires a small handful of interns each year compared to the other company's 10,000+ (but obviously is much smaller). Might look more impressive on the resume for recruiters who know.

Okta cons:

* FAANG - good brand name, whereas many people haven't heard of Okta.
* Alternative has more products and opportunities than Okta, which has only a handful of niche product offerings

However, I am getting a little overwhelmed as it's a long interview session.

Neetcode's videos of the Blind 75.

Cracking the Coding Interview book (also within the blind 75 topics)

Common sense guide to DS&amp;A

Affirmative Action is a contentious issue. At the university level, there are valid arguments to be made. But as far as hiring practices in Big Tech, I don’t get how anyone has an issues. 

As far as I know, there are special programs to get women in minorities into tech. Sometimes there’s diversity and inclusion internships which were made for minorities only. Résumés from minorities probably go straight to the top of the pile. 

But I have no issue with any of these. Anyone that pretend sexism and racism isn’t an issue in tech opportunities and in the workplace/school is an idiot. These hardly makeup for the disadvantage that is discrimination. 

Plus, the hardest part of breaking into tech isn’t getting the interview, it’s passing the interview. This year has been an anomaly, with the economy and all the hiring freezes. But typically, and this is especially true after the entry level, it’s not really that hard to just get an interview.

csMajors,"Fair warning, this is going to be long. Now that I’ve chosen an internship for this coming summer, I wanted to make a post about these past few months. Although there are some posts about PM/TPM internships, there isn’t as much information compared to SWE internships. I also wanted to show the Computer Information Systems majors that I know for a fact lurk this sub (cause i do lol) that you can get internships without being a CS major. I also want to show you guys what companies/roles i got interest for as a non-cs major
My background/ resume: I’m a CIS major (junior)  at a no name state school. I have a 3.5 GPA. I transferred from a community college to my state school this fall. I own a small business. I was lucky enough to land a sophomore internship with EY as a technology consultant intern while I was still at community college. I worked under a PM while I was there and used that work experience on my resume to target PM internships this year. I also have some classes I took on my resume (Computer hardware and software architecture, database design and development, communication systems, systems design and analysis etc). I also have a research project on my resume from a class i took at my cc on Human Sexuality. It was a risk putting it on my resume but I thought it might be an interesting talking point and I was right. My interviewers asked me about it alot. 

My interviews: First I would like to say that I’m not a strong coder. I know a bit of python and SQL but that’s it. I don’t know DS&amp;A and I’ve never done a LC question in a language outside of SQL in my life. I also had a return offer from EY.

Palantir Deployment Strategist:  I went through the phone screen and it was ALL behavioral. I withdrew from the process after I figured out more about the role and how LONG their interview process is. I didnt do final interviews.

Jane Street Business Development Analyst: I did the take home assignment (Excel) but I withdrew from the process after phone screen because I honestly wasn’t interested in the role. I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for business dev.

Mastercard PM: The interviews were all behavioral and technical questions (no coding)They grilled me on my resume with an extra focus at my time at EY under the PM. I declined their offer because honestly, their interviewers were very dull and they didnt even seem excited to be working there. Also, the work wasn’t interesting and they pay was LOW. I had a return offer from EY paying more so.

Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: I did the hirevue and assessment but I was ghosted after that. 

Walmart PM: I did a personality assessment and final interviews were Behavioral/ product sense/ design. one question was directly off glassdoor. I declined their offer because I ended up getting the offer I wanted. 

Oracle PM: It was weird, I applied for PM but they wanted to move me forward for a security engineer role even though I have absolutely nothing on my resume related to cyber security. I told the interviewer/recruiter that I wasn’t interested in that role and she agreed to move me back over to PM. I did a phone screen that was rushed. Honestly the interviewer didnt seem to be listening to be at all lol. It was all behavioral. I got ghosted after the phone screen. 

‘That’ FAANG company Program Manager: This isnt a PM role and I knew that. It was all behavioral. Really hit hard on your LP’s because they will grill you on them with follow up questions. They really dig into your resume.  I got an offer but I’m declining it because I got an offer for the role I want. 

‘That’ FAANG company (again) Business Intelligence Engineer: The interviews were half behavioral, half technical. Again, study LP’s. I was also asked Easy/Medium SQL leetcode questions and basic questions about statistics (standard deviations etc). I was rejected after final rounds. 

Expedia PM: I completed an assessment and a Hirevue asking product sense questions. Final interviews were a mix of behavioral/technical (no coding)/ and a case study that was honestly a product design question. They grilled me on my resume. I got an offer. I’m declining it. 

Google Bold: I got the questionnaire but I haven’t heard from them since I submitted it. I’m exhausted after these past few months anyway so I’m withdrawing from the process. 

Google APM: I was rejected after resume screen.

Microsoft Customer Success AND TPM: I’m bunching these together because I went through the process for both of these roles at the same time. Microsoft is SLOWWWW so these processes took months. For customer success, Both the first and final round interviews were ALL behavioral and analytical questions. They are looking for someone who is customer obsessed because the role is customer facing/ post-sales. I got an offer but I declined it because I wanted TPM
For TPM- Mainly behavioral but they do ask alot of analytical, hypothetical, and product sense/design questions. They grilled me on my resume HARD. They care more about your thought process in product design questions than they do about your solution. They want to make sure you can handle ambiguity. I got an offer for TPM. that is the one I’m accepting. 

I know this was long. But maybe it can help someone who’s prepping for interviews. I used cracking the PM book, exponent website/ youtube videos to prepare for my interviews. Anything more than that is overkill.

Palantir Deployment Strategist:  I went through the phone screen and it was ALL behavioral. I withdrew from the process after I figured out more about the role and how LONG their interview process is. I didnt do final interviews.

Jane Street Business Development Analyst: I did the take home assignment (Excel) but I withdrew from the process after phone screen because I honestly wasn’t interested in the role. I originally applied for a PM internship but they decided to move me forward for business dev.

Mastercard PM: The interviews were all behavioral and technical questions (no coding)They grilled me on my resume with an extra focus at my time at EY under the PM. I declined their offer because honestly, their interviewers were very dull and they didnt even seem excited to be working there. Also, the work wasn’t interesting and they pay was LOW. I had a return offer from EY paying more so.

Warner Bros (Discovery) PM: I did the hirevue and assessment but I was ghosted after that. 

Walmart PM: I did a personality assessment and final interviews were Behavioral/ product sense/ design. one question was directly off glassdoor. I declined their offer because I ended up getting the offer I wanted. 

Oracle PM: It was weird, I applied for PM but they wanted to move me forward for a security engineer role even though I have absolutely nothing on my resume related to cyber security. I told the interviewer/recruiter that I wasn’t interested in that role and she agreed to move me back over to PM. I did a phone screen that was rushed. Honestly the interviewer didnt seem to be listening to be at all lol. It was all behavioral. I got ghosted after the phone screen. 

‘That’ FAANG company Program Manager: This isnt a PM role and I knew that. It was all behavioral. Really hit hard on your LP’s because they will grill you on them with follow up questions. They really dig into your resume.  I got an offer but I’m declining it because I got an offer for the role I want. 

‘That’ FAANG company (again) Business Intelligence Engineer: The interviews were half behavioral, half technical. Again, study LP’s. I was also asked Easy/Medium SQL leetcode questions and basic questions about statistics (standard deviations etc). I was rejected after final rounds. 

Expedia PM: I completed an assessment and a Hirevue asking product sense questions. Final interviews were a mix of behavioral/technical (no coding)/ and a case study that was honestly a product design question. They grilled me on my resume. I got an offer. I’m declining it. 

Google Bold: I got the questionnaire but I haven’t heard from them since I submitted it. I’m exhausted after these past few months anyway so I’m withdrawing from the process. 

Google APM: I was rejected after resume screen.

Microsoft Customer Success AND TPM: I’m bunching these together because I went through the process for both of these roles at the same time. Microsoft is SLOWWWW so these processes took months. For customer success, Both the first and final round interviews were ALL behavioral and analytical questions. They are looking for someone who is customer obsessed because the role is customer facing/ post-sales. I got an offer but I declined it because I wanted TPM
For TPM- Mainly behavioral but they do ask alot of analytical, hypothetical, and product sense/design questions. They grilled me on my resume HARD. They care more about your thought process in product design questions than they do about your solution. They want to make sure you can handle ambiguity. I got an offer for TPM. that is the one I’m accepting. 

I know this was long. But maybe it can help someone who’s prepping for interviews. I used cracking the PM book, exponent website/ youtube videos to prepare for my interviews. Anything more than that is overkill. These past few months have been exhausting and I’m happy to be finished with recruitment season.",My journey to get a PM internship,"Fair warning, this is going to be long. Now that I’ve chosen an internship for this coming summer, I wanted to make a post about these past few months. Although there are some posts about PM/TPM internships, there isn’t as much information compared to SWE internships. I also wanted to show the Computer Information Systems majors that I know for a fact lurk this sub (cause i do lol) that you can get internships without being a CS major. I also want to show you guys what companies/roles i got interest for as a non-cs major
My background/ resume: I’m a CIS major (junior)  at a no name state school. I have a 3.5 GPA. I transferred from a community college to my state school this fall. I own a small business. I was lucky enough to land a sophomore internship with EY as a technology consultant intern while I was still at community college. I worked under a PM while I was there and used that work experience on my resume to target PM internships this year. I also have some classes I took on my resume (Computer hardware and software architecture, database design and development, communication systems, systems design and analysis etc). I also have a research project on my resume from a class i took at my cc on Human Sexuality.

csMajors,"Not a flex post and really appreciate any advice on helping me decide on these 2 offers. This is also going to be my last internship so I am hoping to get a return offer for new grad (at least as a backup offer for next year). The internship pay for Salesforce and Bloomberg is around the same.

Salesforce:

Pros:

* SF seems fun
* Large intern groups
* Good WLB
* High return offer rate
* Already know my team and the manager &amp; developer in my team are extremely nice

Cons:

* Not sure if I am really interested in working on the team's product, but the manager said I could work combine what I am interested in with their products
* According to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi), Salesforce has lower TC (new grad) than Bloomberg

Bloomberg:

Pros:

* Interning at NYC will be so much fun
* Corporate Housing
* Good WLB
* Also high return offer rate?
* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on, but according to the recruiter there will be a team matching process and they will try to match me to a team that aligns with my interests
* Higher TC according to [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)

Cons:

* Not sure about which team I am going to be placed on
* Might be harder to get a Salesforce new grad offer than a Bloomberg new grad offer so I might still get the offer from Bloomberg if I try again next year?

csMajors,"TL:DR
CS degree takes all my free time and I cant study actually important coding skills.

Im in my second year of CS and I have started to look for internship options. Almost every place requires something I am not familiar with (Node.js, Spring, Angular...).

I really like programming and would like to learn these technologies, but I have to spend almost all my free time studying for classes unrelated to coding. 

Im not saying that I did not learn usefull things, I had classes where we studied (Java, CSS, HTML, Python, architechtures, DBs, algorithms..), but almost half of my classes are math related.

For example, instead of learning what I want and find useful for applying for a job or making projects, I spend almost all my free time studying statistics, probability and mathematical analysis.

Is this normal?

But basically, exactly what the title says. She applied in bulk in September and received multiple interviews (for full transparency, I would say 4-5 of those were through/at Grace Hopper). She’s a sophomore. During this time I was stressing out doing leetcode problems and not applying - I’m a junior who switched into CS fairly late. 

She received a total of 5 offers, and the top contenders were a very reputable tech company and a very solid bank. In comparison, I have had a few interviews lined up along with a couple tens of rejections. 

I would ask her after each interview how it went and generally she would say it was okay. I remember telling her how I couldn’t grasp DP problems and she didn’t even know what DP was 😭 Her hardest interview was Jane Street where they asked about trees. 

I would say we’re on par in terms of skill and knowledge. We’re really close haha despite how this post may sound but I don’t like to pry, especially with how stressful this process has been for me. But ya, I’ve seen firsthand her coding abilities and she’s just a normal, competent student. So I’m not sure if she’s gotten extremely lucky, I’m the most unfortunate mf ever, or if the LC grind is just overhyped. 

A theory I have is that she’s just a really good communicator. With the few interviews I’ve had, I’ve been rejected at the behavioral stage ://

csMajors,"Sophomore rn, spent last summer at Nvidia doing Ignite. Had a lot of fun, even though it was remote. Learnt a lot and wondering whether I should go back or try something new?

Interests:

Infra/Devops and recently ML Eng(infra specifically)

All pay about the same/ Internship TC doesn't really matter to me,

Also did final rounds with Amazon(which I think went pretty well, solved the LC and aced the LPs) and in the process with Hashicorp(which I like and confident will work out).

M pros:

They really care about their interns + nice perks.

Decent resume value?

Almost guaranteed return offer next summer(so long as I do my shit obviously haha)

M cons:

in Seattle(would rather be in nyc/east coast)

Not sure what team I'll be on --&gt; crapshoot.

STEP pros: 

Good pipeline(no need to reinterview afaik) to  swe intern  which would be ..nice next summer.

Good resume value?

cons:

in MTV(boring asf location, hoping I can change locations to nyc)

a sophomore program

only gives about 6k pre-tax housing which sounds like a nightmare to find in mtv

Bloomberg pros:

in nyc + corp housing which is pretty nice.

I'd be working with their cloud infra(interesting tech stack)

Good pipeline to quant shops swe(?) - someone pls correct me if I'm wrong. my goal is 2S next summer. 

Cons:

hmm, not a pure tech co?

not as much resume value?

Nvidia pros:

Loved the company and team, i'd be in a different team tho.

new team is exactly what I'm interested in and pretty high impact( building ML Infra for computer vision)

Could either go remote(pro) or be in Santa Clara(con)

cons:

considering trying something new

Santa Clara would be less than ideal

Not the most exciting tech stack

I'm a sophomore, so not really worrying too much about return offers. Not sure what I want to do in the future: really conflicted about whether I should try and go into SWE @ trading firms or regular SWE at tech companies.

Akuna Python Dev (Chicago) Pros: Quant, more selective, know I'm definitely in a Python team. Cons: probably worse WLB, worse name brand (is this true??), Python might not be that useful (?), kinda got lowballed (does this mean they don't really care about me and won't give me good work?).

Amazon SDE Intern (Seattle): Pros: Amazon is a big tech company/FAANG+, probably better name brand recognition, better WLB, *infinite* free bananas. Cons: team matching is fucked, work might not be that impactful/interesting.

Akuna Python Dev (Chicago) Pros: Quant, more selective, know I'm definitely in a Python team. Cons: probably worse WLB, worse name brand (is this true??), Python might not be that useful (?), kinda got lowballed (does this mean they don't really care about me and won't give me good work?).

Amazon SDE Intern (Seattle): Pros: Amazon is a big tech company/FAANG+, probably better name brand recognition, better WLB, *infinite* free bananas. Cons: team matching is fucked, work might not be that impactful/interesting.

csMajors,"Writing this post as part-appreciation, part-advisory, part-self-validation. Like many others, I wrote my first line of code in my freshman year. Grew up in a one-income family, only ever been through shitty public schooling, no competitive math background, public uni. Now after 4 semesters, I have various offers most notably from JS, Akuna, Cit/Citsec, and HRT; likely signing HRT over the rest. Wouldn't say I deserve them 100%, but still gonna try to share some insight.

This subreddit is an insane motivator. As a long-time lurker, the usual self-congratulatory post (kinda like this 1) left me happy for my peers but also feeling so inadequate. Every step of the way up, I was never complacent because of this subreddit. Ego and pride can do crazy things for your overall motivation, so for that I'm grateful.

The single most important thing that's helped me through the years is recognizing that recruitment is largely not a meritocracy. The difference between someone who got an offer vs. someone who didn't could be chalked up to having nicer interviewers or easier questions. So many small things that are out of your control can significantly impact your odds (e.g. signing up for an interview on Tuesday instead of Wednesday so you get a shitty, power-tripping interviewer). This is how I was able to convince myself that I'm able to achieve these things in the face of rejection, and dodge all feelings of impostor syndrome. With that being said though, you can lower your variance in interview performance as a result of these outside factors with solid prep, naturally.

My advice focuses primarily on engineering in a quant firm context. The hardest part about all of this is knowing where to focus your time. Everybody has a life outside of school/recruitment, so ensuring that the time you spend with your head in the books is spent optimally is so so important. It's a good feeling and super motivating when you know the things you are doing \*will\* secure future gains (like going to the gym), and not going to waste.

1. Learn C++ ASAP. Python just feels nice and I used it as a crutch for so long, but I can attribute most of my successes to making the switch. The level of complexity on problems as you move up are just more efficiently tackled with C++'s robust STL. For instance, keeping pointers to nodes in a BST would require your own class implementation in Python, but C++ has this baked in. Also, some companies require you to interview in C++, (e.g. HRT, Akuna). A good way to get practice is to just start doing LC or building projects w/ cpp. Start coding by guessing bits of syntax, and correct them as you go along until it becomes natural.

2. Ditch web development. Wasted a solid 6 months on this. One of the biggest misconceptions I had starting out was that most engineers focus exclusively on web development, and that getting a solid footing in web dev would do me wonders for my job prospects. Unless you genuinely have a passion for it and it makes you happy, don't bother with it. I want to say this advice is applicable to big-tech roles too.

3. Learn some basic finance. If you can demonstrate that you understand what different classifications of securities are, basic trading strategy, surface-level understanding of options theory, and show that you're ""genuinely"" interested in finance, it goes a long way to leave a better impression on your interviewers prior to starting your coding questions. Building a rapport before the technical part starts is so important for mental. For both you and your interviewer. People are always biased towards more charismatic candidates, whether they're aware of it or not. (There have been some interviews where I've shit the bed, but moved on anyway -- I want to attribute this to maintaining a good relationship with my interviewer). It's surprising to know how many people fail hiring manager rounds bc they couldn't explain why they wanted to make the switch from tech to finance (other than for money obv).

4. It's been said many times in this subreddit before, but don't sleep on OS, comp arch, graphics, distributed systems. These are all notoriously difficult classes but all give you a better chance at interviewing in high-frequency trading. Naturally, building low-latency systems requires a strong foundation in all the above, save for graphics which just gives you a great command of C++.

5. Replace your projects for more relevant projects in performant languages. Build an orderbook, a simulated market maker, unix-like shell, webserver, or whatever you'd like. There are many tutorials online for all of these things, just make sure you can explain them.

csMajors,"Accepted Amazon a month ago already but just received an offer for Khan Academy. I'm a sophomore, so I still have another year of internships. Also from a mid-tier CS co-op school, so Amazon would actually help my resume decently. Very sad cause Khan Academy actually seems like a cool company to work for (minus lower pay, but it's non-profit).

I'll write about the Khan Academy process in another post since that was missing information in Reddit when I was personally going through the process.

Amazon Pros:

* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* High pay + housing stipend (standard 9138/mo + 2400 relo stipend).
* Higher brand name/prestige as big tech, would make future internships much easier to obtain.
* Won't have to renege.
* Already made a LinkedIn post and farmed profile views.

Amazon Cons:

* Probably going to be low-impact work on internal tooling that never sees the light of day.
* Seattle, Bezos's Balls.
* Potential to do boring front-end-only work or do 80hrs in an AWS team (?).

&amp;#x200B;

Khan Academy Pros:

* I would genuinely be making an impact on the world. From my discussions in the interviews, it feels that the intern projects help Khan Academy towards their goal.
* Work seems more fun as well.
* They only take 6 interns per year, so potentially intimate environment? And I'll probably be able to meet Sal Khan.
* Great culture and WLB.
* Aligns better with my profile (my main resume project is EdTech, my main uni club experience is working with non-profits).

Khan Academy Cons:

* Probably riskier in these macroeconomic times.
* Remote. My last internship was remote and it was not that fun.
* Lower pay ($46.15/hr) and no relo stipend (I think).
* Less prestige(?) - likely would be harder to secure future internships.
* Would have to delete Amazon LinkedIn post and pretend it never happened (but at least I can farm more profile views for Khan Academy??)",Renege Amazon for Khan Academy (Summer 2023 Internship)?,"Accepted Amazon a month ago already but just received an offer for Khan Academy.

csMajors,"I just *have to* vent. Just a minor disclaimer that English isn’t my first language.

I’m taking System Analysis and Design this term and we had to make groups of 3/4 students to complete a class project (designing a system) of ten parts (SSR, Gantt chart, system requirements, use case, DFD, activity diagram, ER diagram, class diagram, system prototype, and a presentation about our fictional system, it’s uses, and the process of making it).

We started by dividing the parts on each student but I want us to at least do the first three steps as a group so - as those parts are the foundation of system we’ll be making. Without a proper understanding of the system, the following 7 steps will be harder to do. But they kept putting it off and delaying that i had to do them myself so we’d have enough time to do the diagrams, prototype, and the presentation.

Now that i have done 3/10 of the project, fairly, i wouldn’t have to be as involved in the following steps, right? I guess not. Because the person who were supposed to do the use case ended up making a use case of an entirely different system. The dumdum copied and pasted a random use case because they don’t even understand what the entire class is even about let alone the project or the fictional system. So i had to do it myself.

Step 5 and 6 went fine as the person who they were assigned to did them with out a fuss or needing me to monitor/review their work.

csMajors,"Hi fellow redditors,

I have recently developed and launched an MVP of Confluo app, a task assistant, for getting task recommendations, building skills and network, and keeping your followers apprised.

I came up with this idea during the covid lockdowns when I was learning and doing a lot of new things and I felt others were engaged in other activities but because of the lockdowns we all felt isolated, and no one had an idea on what others were up to. To cope with the situation, many people started hosting virtual study and working sessions on discord, meetup, or zoom, many of which I have also joined. Essentially these sessions put you in a video or audio call that gives you a feeling of accountability as you work with others.

Even though lockdowns are over, the virtual sessions are not. Our work and study have increasingly shifted online. But I feel having to connect through a video or audio call while studying or working is an overkill and doesn't apply to all kinds of activities, such as running, sports or gym. So, I introduced a highlight field in a task that would get shared with others as the task is added to the calendar. IMO, sharing with others the highlights of what you're working on should be enough to build accountability without having to attend a video or audio session.

On the other hand, when it came to managing my tasks and activities, I felt no matter which task management app I used I would stop using it after a while. The problem wasn't that managing tasks through the app was difficult. Rather, the app didn't provide any incentive other than push notifications for me to open it. Opening such apps wasn't a joy. Instead, they demanded certain level of determination and discipline.

As we have an inherent desire to find out what our friends and followers are up to, I think having a feed of highlights shared by others should make the app enjoyable to open and keep it engaging.

Finally, I also wanted to track the skills and the number of hours I have worked, So I also included an option to add skills to each task. As I add a task to the calendar its corresponding skills get added to my profile for the duration of the task.

My current problem is I'm finding it difficult to test it with willing participants and get their thoughts. I have of course shared it with my friends. But being an introvert, I hardly have 10 close friends and family members and not all of them use apps for managing tasks. Nonetheless, a couple of them tested it and gave me some useful feedback which I have already incorporated to simplify parts of it.

Hence, I'm reaching out to you redditors if you would be interested in giving it a try. The app doesn't feature any advertisement and all the features I've mentioned above are completely free as I am not looking to make money, just trying to validate if people would use an app like this. Nor I'm looking to promote the app. I would be happy if just 50-100 people use the app and provide me some direct feedback on their experience rather than 1000s of people without any feedback.

I have programmed it in flutter so it's available on both Android and iOS. If you're interested, please go to [https://confluo.app](https://confluo.app) and give it a go. But more importantly, please DM me your thoughts. Thanks!",Frustrated indie developer looking for willing users to try my app,"Hi fellow redditors,

csMajors,"I am a junior at a reputable uni at my country (but hardly at top 500 in the world). First of all, in my sophomore year, I felt like I needed to learn some stuff to get an internship and focused on web development with React, Node and Flask. I got an internship in a company that is not so bad and I think I had a good internship period. However I did not receive a part-time job offer afterwards, which most of my friends did. It made me feel very insecure about myself and I recently started pushing too much on myself. I am trying to increase my GPA (3.20 currently) and I am re-taking a class. I am still learning about web-dev but it feels wrong somehow. It feels like I am on the wrong path, because I am either ignored or rejected after an interview when I apply for part time jobs. I don't know what I am doing wrong. I lost my courage to build projects for my portfolio. In the internship I completed all of the tasks I was given and near the end even my supervisor stated how pleased he has been with me. I am just constantly questioning myself. I am even thinking of switching majors or pursuing an academic career (the main reason why I am trying to increase my GPA). I have also recently started grinding leetcode.

csMajors,"I have wanted to write this post for a long time, but since I finally got done with recruiting for summer 2023 I decided to finally write this. In this post, I will be telling you how I broke into tech. For context, I went from failing every single Online Assessment to getting offers from multiple medium - big tech companies including FAANG and multiple social media companies (non-FAANG) in a year. While I believe everyone's journey in tech is very different, I do think if someone gets the basics right and works hard enough they can break into tech, and here I will try to summarize all the resources and tips I used to achieve what I wanted to. I gave a friend these tips and he used them to get his dream internship and that too in a recession ;)

&amp;#x200B;

**A bit of background:** I go to a T5 CS school but I am an international student so while I did have some advantages, I had a lot of disadvantages during my job search. Small companies wouldn't hire me so I could not get much experience and big companies wouldn't hire me because I did not have much experience. Breaking this cycle was very very challenging.

&amp;#x200B;

So I started college in the Fall of 2019 as an ECE major but switched to CS before the end of the school year. I took the Data Structures class in the Fall of 2020 and the Algorithms class in the Spring of 2021. While my grades in school were amazing, I struggled with a lot of school assignments and barely made an A. I knew the theory but I barely understood how to apply Data Structures and Algorithms to technical questions and, this ultimately translated into poor interview performance and no internships for two consecutive summers.

&amp;#x200B;

**What changed:** During the summer of 2021, while all my friends were already working at their SWE internships, I did a minimum wage part-time job at my school and spent the rest of the time mainly on leetcode. I started with a pace of 3 questions a day and went up to 10 questions a day. The number of questions depended on the topic I was doing. I am not a genius by any means, and it takes me quite a bit of time to understand a lot of these concepts but I was willing to spend that time. Initially, the easy questions, like valid parenthesis, took me more than 3 hours to understand but it has gotten a lot better and I am currently at about 600 questions with about 150 easy questions, 370 medium questions, and 80 easy questions. I also did some mock interviews with a friend (he is such a GOAT) so I could get constructive feedback which I could use to improve myself. I took a light course load in the Fall 2021 semester and focused on leetcode and recruiting.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is how you could get started with leetcode and achieve a similar result:

1.  Learn the very basics of Data Structures. This ([https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/algorithms/study-cheatsheet/)) seems like a great place to start.
2. As soon as you learn your first Data Structure, do leetcode for that topic and continue learning other data structures.
3. In the interest of time, you can look up the solution after 1 hour of trying.
4. After you do one question do similar questions. Try to draw connections between these questions and apply the concept you just learned.
5. Don't lose hope, leetcode is hard for everyone.
6. Repeat and keep doing it until you understand the data structures well.   


**Here are some lists of questions that I think are good**:

1. [https://neetcode.io/practice](https://neetcode.io/practice)
2. [https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\\\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75?order=all\_rounded&amp;mode=all&amp;weeks=26&amp;hours=15&amp;grouping=none)
3. https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/

&amp;#x200B;

I did not follow any list when I started. I first did all the topics and once I started getting interviews I did tag questions for the company which enables me to do so many questions. I am not sure if these lists contain the same questions but they do seem to contain some of the best leetcode questions. Go in the following order while completing questions in these lists:

1. Blind 75
2. neetcode 150
3. grind 75
4. sean prashad

Once you finish these lists, do as many questions on leetcode as you can. Try doing at least medium difficulty. As I said above, it is okay to look up solutions as long as you understand why the solution works. I would suggest making a leetcode account so all the progress is in one place. You can also use lintcode to access leetcode premium questions. Some of the best solutions I found on leetcode were in the discuss section (sort by most votes for best results). While I did throw a lot of information here, I understand going through hundreds of questions is not possible for everyone but I highly recommend following the lists I mentioned above. I also suggest joining this discord server if you are recruiting for an internship / new grad job. One more thing, ask people for referrals either from your friends or people on LinkedIn. Maybe it becomes the reason you get your dream job. Please be kind to yourself and the people around you :)

I’m a junior right now, so I’m considering these company’s full-time value (but I don't know too much about this). I was in the Bay Area last summer, so hoping to live in NY or Seattle. 

**Datadog:**

NY

$52/hr + 6k housing stipend

Pros: lunch MWF, everyone I know who’s worked there *really* enjoys it, strong intern and new grad program, high return to full time rate, nice NY office

Cons: I don’t know much about the name value (I haven’t heard of it until this recruiting cycle)

**Atlassian:**

Remote (I can choose to go into any office)

$54/hr (SF), $49/hr (NY) + 3k stipend

Pros: I’ve used their product before and like it enough, know their name value, heard about great culture, lunch daily

Cons: The remote situation; worried that most people won’t go into office when I’m looking for an in person experience, less comp, a little more of a coasting company

**Asana:**

SF

$75/hr + 1.5k stipend

Pros: I’m most passionate about their product, breakfast + lunch daily, heard there’s decent culture, could potentially move to NY office for new grad (but not sure abt this)

Cons: not in NY

Thank you! any input is appreciated!

1) Hiring aggressively and didn’t have any sign to stop in 2021

3) Not recession proof (not necessary), or heavily affected when cutting cost

I spent my entire summer grinding leetcode, learning operating systems, studying c++, and doing a bunch of OA's and interviews as well. I even reneged a good internship offer for the one I took over the summer for the hopes of it making my resume more competitive (and I am most likely blacklisted, as I applied again this year but haven't receieved a single response).

Well, all of that was for nothing, maybe I still have a massive skill issue, but out of every application I sent, I either got ghosted, straight up rejected, or bombed the phone/final. And the new grad cycle will only be harder, as not only are the interviews longer and more difficult, but I will be competing against people with previous quant internships as well.

csMajors,"I was fortunate enough to get two summer 2023 internship offers, but I'm not sure which one to pick.

BNY Mellon is $38.46/hr for 10 weeks in Pittsburgh, PA

Progressive Insurance is $24/hr for 12 weeks and is remote

I don't live in Pittsburgh, so I would have to pay for housing, food, gas, etc. if I go with BNY Mellon, but with Progressive I could work from home, so I think it would probably be a similar amount of money in the end (let me know if my thinking here is incorrect). 

I'm also not sure which internship would have more interesting work. I know someone who interned at BNY Mellon, and he said he basically just wrote JUnit tests all summer which doesn't sound that appealing. He did mention that other interns got put on more interesting projects though. I also like the idea of being in person. At the Progressive info session, they said their interns get assigned to a project and then a side project of their choosing, so it sounds like it might be more engaging?

Has anyone interned at either of these two companies for SWE? Any other factors that I should be considering? Any insight is appreciated!

csMajors,"I wanted to post this because I have seen some of the things posted on here about how screwed you will be without internships, grinding LC, and all of that. I started to believe this too and thought there was little chance of me getting a job (May grad). Of course these are good things to do and have, but I think it gets exaggerated on here.   

I went to a recruiting event at my college and ended up having a really good conversation with a recruiter for the company. I sent my application in, took my OA, and then did the phone screen which led to the technical interview. I studied the questions posted on Glassdoor, but ended up getting a different coding question. I answered all the OOP based questions well and had a really good talk with the interviewer. For the coding question, I didn’t pass a single test case and was going back to fix my code when he stopped me. He told me that he was actually just looking to see my thought process and how I went about solving it and that I was on the right track. Anyone I asked told me that since I got the question wrong I was cut and someone even told me I should be embarrassed I didn’t get it.    

Anyways, I end up getting moved to the final round which is supposedly behavioral. Well, they pull out another coding question haha. I did better on this one, but ultimately didn’t quite get it in time. We actually talked through it after he stopped me and I was correct, just had a couple things out of order. Once again, this interviewer also told me that the main thing was my communication skills and thought process. 

A week later I received an offer and this is the company I have wanted to work at since I started college. From reading here and Discord, I had multiple people tell me that there is no shot, so I was really surprised because I had started to believe them lol. They said that they really enjoyed how I went about the problems and communicated clearly. My point in posting this is not to brag or anything close. To the people that feel they have no hope because of internships, LC, or whatever it is - this isn’t true! I don’t see as many people on here talk about the importance of communicating and having good conversation during the interviews. In my head, I was thinking either way I want to have learned something from the devs that interview me and this lead to good vibes during the interview.     

Keep working to get internships and grinding LC, but do not think you are totally screwed and will never get a job otherwise.

So far I have applied to over 150 different companies between both and have done 64 Online Assessments to date, about 20 second round interviews and have done 3 Final Round interviews for Flexport, Expedia USA and HPE.

I am registering for my last semester, and I only have one kind of fluffy elective left to take, and can optionally add Calc III to complete a math minor.

I didnt have an easy time with Calc I or II, but still pushed through to get As, and have reviewed periodically to keep it fresh. I did a pretty intense review about 9 months ago leading up to taking Physics II last semester. I took Calc I and II 15+ years ago, but still seems to click for me when I go through text books and exercises.

I am not really sure what my long term plans are for the future. I could see myself continuing with an MS program. Near term I want to get into more interesting work, proper SWE of some sort. Stuck in an ops/eng/admin world now and while it pays well its boring and aggravating work. 

Would it be better to spend more time going through DSA texts and ""grinding leetcode"" to buff up for SWE roles, or would having Calc III and a math minor be useful to convince some grad school that its worth accepting an older adult? Could it come in handy in its own right for SWE roles? 

I had previously convinced myself I would go for it. Now that I am in the tail end of the degree the lazy part of me just wants to be done with as little effort as possible. Could use some nudges one way or the other.

I am reading past posts where this was asked from others now as well.

csMajors,"Wrapped up my internship at the rainforest in August with an inclined voted. After ending my internship, I was met by radio silence and emailed ASP asking for an update and got two replies in thread. The first one basically said ASP needed additional time finalizing offers due to changing business needs and to sit tight. Then my recruiter (listed in Graebel) replied with ""Hi. I am truly sorry for the delays. I checked on this for you and your hiring manager didn't uploaded your internship performance evaluation form which delays a final decision. They did log an inclined vote, barring any additional complications (e.g., headcount approvals, immigration restrictions)...""

I unclenched a lot after this because I thought was home free, but this morning, I got blindsided by a rejection email from ASP. I immediately replied and got confirmation later this afternoon that I am not receiving a return offer.

TLDR: The goal is a higher starting salary, BS in CS + MS in CS is easier but both are reasonable

Currently, a freshman majoring in CS with no declared minor or double major. I was planning out all 4 years and I realized I could get a master's on top of my BS in four years. It's just a matter of choosing what to get the master's in. If I choose CS it would not be that difficult since my school allows a lot of overlap when it comes to BS and Graduate requirements. I would have to either overload my schedule or take a couple of courses over the summer (asynchronously or online) but I would be taking less rigorous courses like Humanities. If I choose an MBA it would require more effort since there's a lot less overlap but it's still doable. This leads to the question of which is worth pursuing. I enjoy CS but the priority is getting the highest starting salary possible as a new grad. Which would be more advantageous? Thanks in advance.

Other Possible Information:

\-T100 school - nothing super impressive

\-On full-ride so nothing would be out of pocket (only if I do it in 4 years though)

\-This is all with internships in mind for future summers

csMajors,"This internship cycle is looking more and more like me not finding anything for this summer. I’m currently taking Data Structures and Algorithms where I have a 100 average, but any faith I have from my experience there is squandered by the LeetCode/OA cycle.

I don’t have any interviews yet after 100 applications. After 3 months of LeetCode, I can’t solve a Medium independently ever, I always require at least a 1 line hint to flesh out a solution myself. I almost never complete an OA without looking for some help online on strategy first, and when I am fully capable of completing an OA, it’s because it was easy enough for an idiot like me to do and the company is less likely to interview me since an oversupply of competing applicants passed their test cases as well (banking / insurance).

csMajors,"Hi all,

For background, I'm a sophomore CS undergrad at a world top 5 uni (not US). I had interned before twice at a medium sized company (that no one of you has heard of), and only really started applying to internships at big companies for next summer.

Summary of my applications:

* Withdrawn: 2
* Ghosted: 5 (includes post-OA)
* Rejected: 6 (includes post-OA)
* Phone interview: 5 (cancelled rest of them after my 2 offers)
* Onsite: 2
* Offer: 2 (one at a well-known public company, other at a top HFT)

I feel very lucky having received an offer in this climate. I feel that applying early (started late August) really helped my chances as most people I know didn't start until October. I was also surprised at how few LC questions I needed to be interview-ready. Communication while problem-solving and being a nice person overall helped me much more.

This post is also to give hope to some of you who believe you need to be an IOI medallist or a math genius to get a SWE offer at HFTs. I am probably smarter than the average person but I am nowhere near the level of some of my peers at uni. My initial target for # of apps was 400, so I wouldn't give up, especially if you try applying to some smaller local companies.","Application process results after ~20 applications (offer at SWE, HFT)","Hi all,

csMajors,"State Farm is $28/hr + 2k housing.

Walmart is $30/hr + 3k housing/relocation OR corporate housing.

Both are in Dallas, TX, which I live close to. My plan is to pocket the housing money while living at home and drive ~40 minutes to both offices.

State Farm is hybrid/fully remote, while Walmart is in-person. 

My dilemma is that the drive to State Farm is more manageable due to hybrid/remote status, which means I’ll be able to pocket the housing money. However, Walmart is in-person and a 40 min drive both ways, which likely means I’d pick corporate housing and lose out on pocketing the money.

I have a few questions:

- Does Walmart have better name value than Stare Farm for resume purposes?
- Assuming I do pick corporate housing and Walmart’s compensation package becomes lower than State Farm, which do I pick?

csMajors,"This is my first recruitment season and i was fortunate enough to make it to the final interview for a company I was really interested in yesterday. The interview was composed of 3 parts: technical, behavior, technical and im pretty sure I aced the first two parts. This was also my first time doing technical interviews. 

After experiencing that third part I feel so dumbfounded and am honestly rethinking my views on the company now. I was lucky enough that the question asked was very simple (actually one I've encountered before so right off the bat I knew of a solution). But as I was typing up my answer the interviewer stopped me because I used a formula he wasn't aware of and basically forced me to restart and implement it another way. This caught me off guard cause I'm 100% sure the way I was answering it didn't violate anything. Also i was told that the point of the technical was to see if I am 1) able to explain my thinking/actions and 2) solve it. Emphasis on explaining my logic. But the interviewer just wouldn't let me code how I felt was right or even hear me out when i tried to explain myself. He would ask me a question and I'd start talking but then he'd just cut me off- sometimes to repeat the same thing I just said. At some point, he even deleted my code to force me to restart, or would give me ""hints"" that would just cause errors and then he'd revert the change and explain it to me as if it was my own actions that caused the mistake.

In the end, I just knew he had a poor judgement of me cause he even shaded me during his closing remarks basically saying I should've just taken his advice to restart without question.

I don't know of this is a common experience but I feel pretty crummy about this. I'm worried my chances are now ruined. Is this a common thing to encounter during a technical?

csMajors,"Hi y'all,

I've been fortunate enough to get offers for DataDog and Bloomberg this upcoming Summer. I'm wondering people think about which program is better!

Location: Both in NYC, 11 Weeks

Salary: The same

Housing: Bloomberg corporate housing or stipend, DDOG stipend only, \~1k higher than BB

Relocation: Bloomberg \~2k, DDOG flights to and from NYC covered

General Intern Life: Both seem to have a very robust intern program (lots of events, socials, networking chances, meaningful work)

Given the offers are almost identical similar, I'm more curious about what the general opinion is on which company has more opportunities/chances for growth/recognizability. I'm currently leaning towards DDOG. 90% conversion rate, tech being the company's moneymaker, and smaller company size makes me lean that way. Thoughts?

csMajors,"Hi everyone! I got Summer 2023 internship offers from JPMC and Zocdoc. Which of the two do you think would be best? I will be a senior after this internship, so my main priorities are (1) How much will I learn at this internship, from my project, and from other employees? (2) How likely is it for me to receive a return offer, and if I do, would I want to return? (3) As a woman in tech, will I feel safe and welcomed there?

JPMC:

* NYC or Jersey City (most interns will be placed at Jersey City)
* $52.88/hour
* $2500 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 3 days required in the office
* 10 weeks
* Heard that full-time return offer rate is pretty high
* My thoughts on it so far: 
   * Pros: 
      * Larger company usually = more stability
      * Higher intern pay (but I've heard there's basically no raise for the return offer new grad pay, which sucks)
      * Better name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year
      * Higher full-time return offer rate
   * Cons: 
      * Unsure if I want to work at a bank since engineers aren't prioritized as much
      * Don't like top-down, very corporate formal culture

Zocdoc: a later-stage health-tech startup that is pre-IPO, used to financially not do so well but switched business plans a few years ago and now doing better

* NYC
* $40.96/hr ($7100/mo)
* $5400 one-time stipend (no housing provided)
* Hybrid: 2-3 weeks in the office
* 10 weeks
* 10 SWE interns in total for next year
* 50% full-time return offer rate and the team I return to depends on what I want and what business needs are
* My thoughts on it so far:
   * Pros:
      * Larger scope project since startup
      * I feel more passionate about health tech than finance
      * Better work culture and prioritization of engineers since it's a tech company
   * Cons:
      * Pay is not very high for NYC's cost of living
      * Worser name recognition for when I do full-time recruiting next year 
      * Lower full-time return offer rate 
      * Full-time return offer is stock options and not RSU

I've heard for both the impact of your project and how much you will learn are team-dependent.

Any opinions would be appreciated. Thanks!

I’m a senior CS. I’ve been hustling since freshman and knew how important grinding Leetcode is to get a foot to big tech companies. But I’m terrible at it. Practice coding questions has became a black hole to me.

My first time planning to do Leetcode was in Summer 2020. I spent 2-3 hours every day until I solved around 30 questions but couldn’t figure out their patterns. The second attempt was signing up for an Algorithms courses so that I could have deadlines and an actual instructor/TA/office hours to get the work done. I failed again because their comprehensive materials and I can’t put up with 20 hours every week to do homework while having 15 credit hours at school and a part-time job. At the third attempt, I decided to pay a big buck to have a private TA to guide me through this painful process, but my internship keeps me super busy to do anything else on the side. Even I made it to the end but I only grasp 70% of the materials and still couldn’t solve a single graph questions without asking for help. My latest attempt was 3 months ago when I decided to go the traditional way — solving only one problem as the first task daily following the  Neetcode150 list. Unfortunately, 18 credit hours and a part-time internship hit me again. I was too stress out to put my head into solving the problem, I got into the shit hole and take a break from coding challenges. The break now take months and I wanted to give up on Leetcode-type questions. But as an international student, getting into big tech comp secures me sponsorship. I now feel shitty about myself, my ability, and my future plan. It started to give me some mental breakdown. I don’t know how to deal with this. I don’t know if I post something on here would help but I really need to let it out.

FYI, all of my passed interview weren’t involved to any Leetcode-type questions. I had 2 internships and a full-time offer that is too low ball (70k with little compensation). That’s why I keep wanting to try, but I’m too exhausted at the same time.",Feel shitty about myself for keep failing at practicing coding questions,"

csMajors,"Is not getting the offer. It's getting the OA for a company you wanted to work for badly after receiving an offer and not giving a shit about it!

I've been there. After constantly applying to internships since late July, consistently doing deep dives on companies only to get attached to how amazing it would be to join them, and getting rejected by all of the above, it's finally paid off.

To everyone still looking for an internship or new grad role, all it takes is one. You will all get there someday. I seriously genuinely am wishing the best for all of you.

I've always wanted to work for Salesforce out of their SF office. I applied in early August, wondered for months when they'd send the OA. I've gone to their Futureforce events and networked with recruiters... until I received the OA today. Instead of being ecstatic, I was stoic.

csMajors,"Hi!

Strategically placed tl;dr: have personal programming exp, am starting CS at uni in 3 months, is working a part-time cs job worth it and manageable? How difficult is getting a cs part time job / internship?
I'm starting my CS degree at a university in South Africa next year in February. I'd like to hear opinions and experiences from fellow CS students / grads who took up a part-time CS-related job during their studies. Below follows a bit of background on my experiences with programming so far.

I've been programming and learning about computers on a software level for quite a few years now, having messed with Javascript when I was 12 or so (didn't get very far at the time). Currently I'm halfway through a medium sized personal Android Studio project using Java, and have some Python experience, as well as 3 years of Delphi from high school (yes, Delphi..). Without sounding full of myself, I think it is of value to note that I score 98% on my practical examinations, so I'm fairly good at what is expected of me at this level, which is honestly stuff I could do 3 years ago..

I'm very enthusiastic about CS, keen to get into the math and theory as well, as I'm always curious about how things work and the problem-solving required to work with software.

As much as university seems exciting now, I know I definitely need some real-world experience to land a good job straight out of university, and I do plan on applying for internships (vacation based, so like a month twice a year) next year already (our academic year is Feb-Dec), but is it possible to work a part-time job / internship during semester months and still manage some shape of a life and spend enough time on my modules? Follow-up, how difficult is it in general to land a part-time job in CS during uni, and does it sound like I'm on the right track? Thanks! Any other tips you have for me around anything I said are welcome as well :)",Part-time job during CS degree,"Hi!

csMajors,"Hi everyone,

I recently got an offer for Optum's (United Health Group) Technology Development Program internship for Summer 2023 and I was wondering if anyone had any experience with this program and could tell me if it is worth it to take the offer. I have two weeks to get back to them but I also wanted to wait to hear back from other companies that I applied for. They offer options in your work schedule such as remote but I wanted to get out of my hometown and opted to be in-person because I wanted to be in a different environment. 

**If anyone interned there I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me:**

**- Your experience or opinions of the experience**

**- technology stack or projects** 

**- work culture**

**- any intern activities or opportunities to connect or hang out with the team**

&amp;#x200B;

\- NC office at Raleigh if you've worked there, which looks cool as it's in the Bank Of America Tower. It's on Six Forks Road if you want to check it out

I've heard about Optum's chill environment and laid-back culture but wanted more details as I couldn't find much about the NC office and the amenities or facilities it offers. 

It's a healthcare company so I'm not expecting too much with the technology stack.  They use the old Microsoft stack along with AngularJS so some stuff seems outdated in terms of cutting-edge technology. As long as I am learning I can't complain.

For context, I'm a junior CS major. I really care about meaningful projects, learning, the work environment, and opportunities to connect with others such as events or hangouts when deciding on offers.

csMajors,"Super grateful to receive both offers, but I'm really struggling with which one to choose. I'm not sure which career path I'd prefer in terms of SWE vs PM, but I know usually it's difficult to transition to SWE as a PM (but relatively easier the other way around). However in terms of company, Microsoft is much better. Here are the details:

Microsoft TPM

* 8k/month
* Corporate housing provided
* Redmond, WA
* Transportation stipend, free car rental

Amazon SDE

* 9k/month + 1.8k/month for housing
* Arlington, VA

I'm considering the following factors, and if anyone can provide further insight on these it'd be very much appreciated and helpful:

* Company culture/WLB (for FT + internship)
* Prestige (both company + role)
* Return offer rate
* SWE vs PM
* Future career prospects (which one would lead to better career prospects post internship, from what I've heard I believe SWE is better just because there are more SWE jobs and it's easier to transition from SWE to PM rather than the other way around)
* Location for full-time (ideally I'd like to be in New York/California, and I know Microsoft is typically mainly in Redmond but I'm not sure about Amazon)
* Salary (also mainly concerned with FT TC, I'm not sure how different it'd be for Microsoft TPM vs Amazon SDE)

For anyone who interned at Amazon in the past or has any insight, would it be possible to defer my offer from summer to fall or winter? I know they typically don't allow it but I've heard of certain situations where people were able to.

csMajors,"Okay to give you a brief description of my situation. I just graduated with a B.sc degree in software engineering from a Nigerian university. I already have my US green card, i would be moving there soon. I am a pretty good javascript(MERN) programmer and have some projects , however i know how competitive the job market is. I have no prior industry experience as a software engineer. I am obviously open to gaining that first trash junior developer job just so that i could have something to potentially put on my resume and gain some experience, however my parents want me to pursue a masters degree because they feel i would have a better chance to get a good starting salary (they seem to think that i can just start making 3 figures). i’m not that naive to think that a company would pay someone with no experience very high just cause he has a masters degree, been trying to tell them for a long time that company’s prefer working experience to a masters degree. so i came here to get opinions.

1.)  As an international student with a degree from a nigerian school, would companies not take my B.sc seriously just because it’s not from an american school?

2.) would a master’s degree help me stand out to employers when i’m job searching? (even tho the recruiter required only a B.sc)

3.) would it be wise to start the masters programme while still job searching and then leave the programme if i find a reasonable job or would it be wiser to continue developing my programming skills till i find a reasonable job or a junior level position?

csMajors,"Sorry this is so long! I just really need to get this off my chest, and I included a TL;DR below! I am currently a sophomore taking 18 credits this semester, alongside a full-time internship at a well-paying unicorn and significant involvement in university project teams/organizations. Since I wasn't allowed to take the semester off due to the requirements of one of my degrees, the company allowed me to work around my class schedule while still working 40 hours a week. 

&amp;#x200B;

I only have 6 weeks left of the internship, including this week, and my design doc just got approved for me to start on my project. I really like the project and team, and am learning a lot, but it's a full-stack project and is taking me a lot of time to learn all of the different components, so I'm worried I won't be able to pull everything together in time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I spoke to my manager today, and apparently he didn't realize I was a sophomore who has only finished up till Data Structures and Algorithms and he thought I was a junior/senior who had taken advanced electives in Databases, Web Systems, etc. when he assigned me to the team/project. He then said that the company moves very quickly, and they don't have time for ""hand-holding"" and explaining a lot of things. My mentor and I only meet once a week, and it's hard to check in with them about my questions too.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I have a good internship already lined up for the summer, for which I didn't have my current company on my resume, so I'm not really interested in getting a return offer. Even though I'm liking the tech I'm working with, I'm feeling a bit burnt out and unmotivated because I know that I don't need the return offer, I'm not able to implement the tools as quickly as they want me too, I have coursework and project teams on my plate which I need to prioritize so that I don't fall behind, and my manager was expecting someone who already took courses on databases, web systems, etc. and didn't know that I'm not there yet.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My internship project is cool but I don't know anything, have a lot on my plate, and my manager was expecting someone with a lot more experience and doesn't want to have to explain stuff to me, which is fair. Since I have a better summer internship already, I'm not that interested in a return offer. I don't want to quit because I don't want to disappoint them, or myself, but I also don't know how to handle the situation anymore.",Need advice: Feeling burnt out and unmotivated during my internship,"Sorry this is so long!

csMajors,"I worked at m@zon last summer and had a very mediocre time. It definitely wasn’t bad, but I didn’t love it. For the most part, I think this is how the average m@zon intern feels about m@zon, though.

Pros:

Had a VERY good work-life balance (a lot of life and not a lot of working)

Stable guarantee of a return offer (especially for full time next year)

Cons:

Didn’t get any free food or in-office amenities (I’m the kind of person that this means a lot to me)

Not very interested in what my team was doing

The way my manager acted towards the team and me definitely rubbed me the wrong way

Could not see myself working therefull time

I’m currently deciding between m@zon and Stripe for next year. My goal this year was to not work for m@zon, but given the current industry situation, it’s been tough getting offers. My current options are to keep m@zon and keep recruiting, or accept Stripe. If I keep m@zon and keep recruiting, in the worst case, I have to work for m@zon again so that’s 2 years of m@zon on my resume that might hurt my chances when I re-recruit for full time. I also am very unsure if companies are still hiring and if I will be able to secure another offer at another company at this point. My main reservation behind choosing Stripe is that I hear Stripe has a terrible work-life balance which is important to me. Is this the case for the interns as well? I also heard Stripe doesn’t give out a lot of return offers and that also worries me. I’m not necessarily that interested in fin-tech so honestly I probably will be just as uninterested in what my team is doing at Stripe as I am at m@zon, but at this point just kind of trying to make the best decision for my future.

I’ll start by saying this: It is entirely my fault that I haven’t been putting as much effort into my CS degree as I should have. I started attending university in 2020 for a 4 year CS degree and I worked just hard enough so I could pass my classes with decent grades. However, I did not put as much effort into actually LEARNING outside of my courses as I should have. And now I’m in my 3rd year and suddenly had an eye opening moment that made me want to learn everything from scratch because my basics are not as solid as they should be. I don’t even know how I would get a job or even an internship when I graduate in a year and a half. How should I go about this? Is it even possible for me to get back on track alongside doing my college courses? 

CS classes I’ve taken so far: 
Principles of CS
Theoretical foundations of CS
Data structures
System level programming 
Computer organization &amp; programming(currently)
Digital image processing (currently)","Feeling like I learned nothing in 2.5 years of my comp sci degree. Want to start over, how do I go about it?","

* Cooler/more fun product
* In the heart of SF 
* Smaller size -&gt; more impact and growth

* Intern corporate housing available
* More established -&gt; job stability

Mainly between the unicorn and the consulting company. All are SWE internships. Sorry for not saying some of the companies, some of them have small intern sizes.

Unicorn would be swe @ cybersecurity, which I think would make me more money after grad, but I'm not particularly interested in this field. However, it is in the tech field, and I haven't had that experience yet.

BCG dv would be swe, and gives out more money for their internship, but I have this feeling that it wouldn't make me as much money after grad. It seems like an interesting field however, but it isn't really in the tech field, so I worry it wouldn't open as much doors as having a tech company on my resume.

csMajors,"Just wanted to share how I’m feeling rn. I’m mentally exhausted with job applications for grad schemes. Previously, companies separated assessments like situational test, video interview and coding test so you only do the next one if you pass the previous stage. Now, they make you do all of them immediately after you’ve submitted your online application. I’m spending every weekend completing all these assessments and whenever I receive a rejection, I just gotta sweep it aside and hustle for the next one. 

This time last year I was in the exact spot applying for a placement role. I hustled so much and submitted hundreds of applications. I’m really thankful to get 3 offers and currently doing my placement at a company I love. However, now I’m just drained because this time I need to find a sponsorship as an international student and the application process is getting more tedious. 

I’d rather be rejected from the beginning if the recruiter feels my cv is not good enough instead of spending hours on mandatory assessments only to be rejected with no feedback. Companies say it’ll only take 120 mins for their assessments, but do they know that preparing for those recorded video interviews takes hours of research and practice?

TC is nearly identical and it doesn't matter to me for a summer internship. Cannot move either to off-season.

This will be my sophomore summer internship (applied to Goldman Sachs with a junior grad year tho). I'm really lucky to be in this position but would like opinions on a decision, especially considering that for my junior summer next year, I will be targeting prop shops/HFT firms like Jane Street, Citadel, 2Sigma for their Trading &amp; Quant Trading roles. GS would feed nicely into that, but I'd be bottlenecked into working in finance. Microsoft TPM opens more general doors in tech, fintech, and finance for all sides (e.g. Google, LinkedIn APM programs and quant TPM program).

Plano TX

90K Salary

10K sign on bonus

IDK if theres stock stuff or other comp

In person :(

&amp;#x200B;

So long story short, I've been at the end of my rope since Fall 2019. Absolutely non-stop work, school, life problems. I am tired mann. I've worked my rear off for years and am now just wanting a job that will pay me well, give me good work life balance, and really really want remote flexibility. It's not just that I wanna work in my underwear, but I genuinely need/want to be at home taking care for family who NEED me. Being able to work remotely a part of the week would mean a lot to me. 

That said, I've done some basic research about JPMC as a whole. I don't like what I'm seeing. A lot of corporate bullshit, hard to get stuff done, long hours, employee tracking, personally the CEO comes off as very ""I own you"" to me. Salaries are underwhelming (I really wanted 100K minimum) and I was looking forward to getting $$$ in stock options but I don't see much about that

Apparently JPMC sets you up well for better opportunities at other companies in the future but I'm not sure how much I care for that right now. I've already been working ""towards my future"" for years. I've sacrificed so much, so much time, my friendships holding on by a thread, and now the thought of going straight from college to professional work? I want to have time for my hobbies finally, I want to spend time with my family, go out with friends, enjoy a moment to myself, but I feel like JPMC is ready to suck the life out of me. I have been waking up thinking about work, grinding all day, and going to bed thinking about work for years. I've solved homework/lab problems in my DREAMS for fucks sake

Should I tough it out? Im going to my school's career center to see what they think about negotiating the offer, but I wanna see what you guys think. I'm tired of being miserable thanks to school, I cannot keep suffering in professional industry too. I am already at my breaking point

If any of you have heard anything about JPMC Plano, let me know

It's not just that I wanna work in my underwear, but I genuinely need/want to be at home taking care for family who NEED me. Being able to work remotely a part of the week would mean a lot to me. 

That said, I've done some basic research about JPMC as a whole. I don't like what I'm seeing. A lot of corporate bullshit, hard to get stuff done, long hours, employee tracking, personally the CEO comes off as very ""I own you"" to me. Salaries are underwhelming (I really wanted 100K minimum) and I was looking forward to getting $$$ in stock options but I don't see much about that

Apparently JPMC sets you up well for better opportunities at other companies in the future but I'm not sure how much I care for that right now. I've already been working ""towards my future"" for years. I've sacrificed so much, so much time, my friendships holding on by a thread, and now the thought of going straight from college to professional work? I want to have time for my hobbies finally, I want to spend time with my family, go out with friends, enjoy a moment to myself, but I feel like JPMC is ready to suck the life out of me. I have been waking up thinking about work, grinding all day, and going to bed thinking about work for years. I've solved homework/lab problems in my DREAMS for fucks sake

Should I tough it out? Im going to my school's career center to see what they think about negotiating the offer, but I wanna see what you guys think. I'm tired of being miserable thanks to school, I cannot keep suffering in professional industry too. I am already at my breaking point

If any of you have heard anything about JPMC Plano, let me know

csMajors,"I'm a freelance proofreader. A lot of people publish on Amazon Kindle and such, not through traditional publishers. As such, they may not have editors or proofreaders, which leads to a lot of mistakes in their books. Typos, grammatical mistakes, missing words in a sentence, extra words (i.e. repeating a phrase twice in a row by accident), continuity errors in a book, etc.

I help with that, and because it's my side gig I only choose to take on clients whose books I actually enjoy. If I think your book is really bad, then I'm not going to do it. So far I've only been doing fantasy and sci-fi because that's what I enjoy and am familiar with.

I charge around $200-$300 per book, depending on the length (I charge per word). And those are low rates, as I haven't been doing it for that long. Experienced editors can charge double or even more.

As to how I got into it - I just started reading a lot of books on Kindle Unlimited and such, and realized there were a lot of already-published books with errors. I figured there would be some demand for an affordable editor.

A lot of people publish on Amazon Kindle and such, not through traditional publishers. As such, they may not have editors or proofreaders, which leads to a lot of mistakes in their books. Typos, grammatical mistakes, missing words in a sentence, extra words (i.e. repeating a phrase twice in a row by accident), continuity errors in a book, etc.

I help with that, and because it's my side gig I only choose to take on clients whose books I actually enjoy. If I think your book is really bad, then I'm not going to do it. So far I've only been doing fantasy and sci-fi because that's what I enjoy and am familiar with.

I charge around $200-$300 per book, depending on the length (I charge per word). And those are low rates, as I haven't been doing it for that long. Experienced editors can charge double or even more.

As to how I got into it - I just started reading a lot of books on Kindle Unlimited and such, and realized there were a lot of already-published books with errors. I figured there would be some demand for an affordable editor.

csMajors,"It's just impossible to get an internship rn.

I'm a junior in college right now but I transferred from CC, so my knowledge is nowhere close to my peers, causing me to perform ""average"" (if not below) in most of my OA's (mid/low 700 scores in CodeSignal). This is no where close enough to even get a phone call back in this year's competitive economy. 

I've applied to like 100 companies and probably got \~15 OA's back, but I've been ghosted after all of them. I don't think my resume is a problem because I asked a few peers, including one at a FAANG, and they said it was fine. (And yes, I asked this person for a referral, and got rejected from that company too). 

The obvious answer is for me to grind LeetCode and self-study, but university takes up almost all of my time, and by the time I get home after a long day I just want to sit in bed. I don't even have time to exercise. This [rant](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/y9ks9i/rant_about_attending_a_good_cs_school/) of someone who goes to my school summarizes it pretty well.

It's already November, and there are barely any companies left for me to even apply to, and even if I apply to like 100 more companies I'll probably fail the OA's because it's just not feasible for me to study hundreds of LC problems rn. 

I'm probably just going to sit in a dark room all Summer playing video games. :/

For clarification:

1st internship runs Jan - March 2023 and is Malware Analyst. It is very stable even in this economy thanks to it being government related and necessary. Which in this economy, looks very nice/makes me lean more towards this one.

2nd internship runs June - Aug 2023 and is software engineering for a cloud marketplace company that does way more cutting edge actual software engineering. I would learn more engineering type skills and it would look better on my resume but I kind of doubt return offers will even be much of a thing considering the economy and it’s a relatively new company. 

Being a malware analyst, I will be extensively analyzing code just not coding anything myself. Which makes me feel meh but I’m also really excited about it regardless especially to be working with international law enforcement and the FBI. But the 2nd internship is more in my playing field and might look better. 

Technically, I could accept both since they don’t overlap, but my real concern here is what if the malware analyst internship offers me a full time job afterwards. The person who interviewed me basically said they give all their candidates return offers and they are always available, which was music to my ears in this economy. But if I already have the 2nd internship then I can’t take it and it’ll look bad if I cancel on the 2nd one and the interviewer said that’s their biggest pet peeve; ppl who back out, they want our answer to be final and binding basically. Not sure what to do here as they are both good opportunities in their own way. I haven’t given any answers to either yet.

Note: I feel like the only way I somehow got these offers was cause I started applying to smaller/more niche companies early on when everyone was aiming for FAANG and other exciting startups in my area.

Even though I solved 300 problems over the year, wasn’t passing any phone interview. The current economic situation and the fact that I’m an international made it more difficult for me. 

From August 2020 I started my job hunting process. Applied on more than 500 positions for Summer’22 internship. Didn’t get any offer after just 2 virtual on-site. I kept grinding whole summer. 

Again started the full-time hunting, but this time I was more prepared and more confident. And very soon every hope was going away as I kept failing phone interviews. Some rejections were so brutal to digest. I know lots of people have felt this way at some point. 

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn’t getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy. 

Fast forward today, I signed an offer as a Software Engineer at a pretty big corporation.

Anyway, after seeing all the suggestions and motivation from the previous post I decided not to beat myself anymore over m a job. I was still applying like crazy but wasn’t getting more interviews due to the hiring freeze and economy. 

Fast forward today, I signed an offer as a Software Engineer at a pretty big corporation.  

Remember, It’s always darkest just before the dawn.

Currently a new grad so just applying to whatever companies as usual, and I got contacted by a third-party recruiter on LinkedIn about two Java positions, the first one, the recruiter mistakenly sent a Mercedes Benz exhaust showcase video as the link to the video introduction of the company (🚩). I gone through the documents, the pay for both are average/below-average for new-grads in the country, and I actually had a couple interviews that have been going pretty well and had offered more money at that point, but I thought more interviews doesn't hurt, so I responded that I'm interested in both.

No idea what happened to the first company, but he did arranged an interview to the second company, it's a small local company that has a semi-monopoly in a few fields in finance and insurance because of local regulations, and their entire tech stack is just Java with JSP and Java Servlet (🚩). Which doesn't sound pleasant but the recruiter also told me that the interview is a single round taking roughly 2 hours, so I thought why not proceed with it.

And then I was told that, the interview will consists of the usual behavior interviews, and a written test about Java with both code and theory. Yes, the interview expect you to handwrite Java code and SQL Queries. (🚩) I thought it's only one round, it will be a pain in the ass but whatever. The recruiter also told me that he will send an email over later with some tips about the interview, which was very nice of him.

Later I received the email from the recruiter and saw the ""tips"" that I was given, which is actually not the tips but just straight up the entire question sheets they will be asking me on the interview (🚩🚩🚩🚩🚩). I was just speechless by this point, he also made sure to mention that ""in order to avoid suspicion, do not score perfectly in the test"". I was flabbergasted and was not sure if this was part of the process of testing my integrity or not.

The day of the interview came, I went to the office, and was just given the test sheet and told to fill it in in the meeting room, and what do you know, its the exact same questionnaire that the recruiter gave me, I did looked up the answers beforehand but decide against just writing down all of it, instead fill in all the sections that I genuinely would have know if I went in blind and leave the rest as blank. During the behavior interviews (which was very straightforward) my mind just went blank and couldn't ask the interviewer any good questions during Q&amp;A as I was just shocked by the whole experience. And I kinda stopped giving a shit about the position and didn't told the interviewer the truth.

csMajors,"I'm doing C++ for reference and like all of my coursework thus far hasn't been as expansive as a legitimate code base.  We're not using a ton of libraries and idk how else to put it but the programming style we're doing now is just textbook example tier. Stuff where you just build up a few classes and a main thread from the ground up by yourself, unlike production level where where you have tons of files already made with distinct naming schemes and ambiguous relations between the files themselves.

On my own time I have tried doing a few personal projects or just browsing through open source repos, and I always find it so hard to parse through all the data and determine dependencies like ""in what file was this other file called"" and stuff like that. I am literally just using the vscode search feature to manually see if a class was used in another file.

We're not using a ton of libraries and idk how else to put it but the programming style we're doing now is just textbook example tier. Stuff where you just build up a few classes and a main thread from the ground up by yourself, unlike production level where where you have tons of files already made with distinct naming schemes and ambiguous relations between the files themselves.

On my own time I have tried doing a few personal projects or just browsing through open source repos, and I always find it so hard to parse through all the data and determine dependencies like ""in what file was this other file called"" and stuff like that. I am literally just using the vscode search feature to manually see if a class was used in another file.

**That Manga SDE Intern:** \~$52 an hour (not negotiable), 12 weeks long, Greater Seattle Area, \~$2400 per month housing stipend, free bananas.

Pros: Manga/big tech name recognition. Likely to work on technology that is more widely used within the industry.

Cons: No team matching process, potential cultural problems. No idea what I will be working on.

**Akuna Python Dev Intern:** \~$65 an hour (in the process of negotiating), 10 weeks long (also negotiatiable to 12 weeks), Chicago, corporate housing, somewhat more perks (gym, snacks etc).

Pros: Potentially makes it easier to break into SWE @ quants/financial firms? Much clearer idea of what I would be working on. Smaller intern cohort.

Cons: Not sure if it is as helpful for helping find other tech jobs in the future. Work may be more niche. Hours/work culture is less chill.

csMajors," I'm a final-year student studying computer science and struggling to get interviews. I also have 9 months of work experience in ABAP, Fiori and React.

For 3 weeks, I applied to over 30 jobs, and I got only 7 rejections and no responses from others which I take as a rejection considering it's been 3 weeks since I applied to them. I think that the work experience it's a bit of useless since I apply to fullstack or backend in C#, Node and React.

csMajors," 

Ugh.  After solving all the LeetCode hard problems in Go, Rust, JS, and C I  finally landed an interview with a FAANG. It went really well. I found  several logic errors in the coding challenge they gave me, they seemed  to appreciate that except for one guy in the interview who was visibly  annoyed with me. The other people in the interview genuinely appreciated  the suggestions I offered. At least I thought so. So, after all this  work, they brought me to their headquarters. I spent a whole day meeting  people and answering questions. They even let me see a secret project  they were working on. They want to deliver packages in partnership with  garbage trucks: it's really pretty smart because those trucks go all  over town and they have lots of unused space. Anyway, they showed me  this secret project and I made a few suggestions like applying a  modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm parallelized  along orthogonal hypercubes. I demonstrated how they could avoid the  duplicate semaphore induction problem while delivering even more  packages than they initially projected. It was great.

Well,  after all that, they never even made me an offer. They just sent me a  generic rejection letter. I asked my recruiter for feedback. She said I  was too smart. Too smart? How can that be? She said I made all the other  developers feel inferior and they didn't want to work with me because of that. And one of the interviewers said I had bad breath, but I think I  can sue them for illegal discrimination on that. I'll keep everyone posted.",Couldn't get an offer because I'm too smart,"

I've been ghosted, rejected based on resume more times than i can count, interviews and rejected, failed skill assessments the works. Its all about finding the right fit for you.

The JP Morgan Chase offer comes from a failed skill assessment, a horrible technical interview but one of the best feeling behavioral / attitude interviews I've ever done. 

I'm not allowed to talk much about my internship due to the nature of the work but it is with a very large company working with a little older code base but its practical agile SWD experience. I work primarily in C/C++ and python with only academic Java experience (this seems to be the main thing holding be back from other places).

My other 2 interviews i had last week were both mixed tech / behavior interviews and i expect to hear good news and I will remain hopeful and ignore the doom posts that seem ever so prevalent.

csMajors,"I finished my foundation year and my first year of computer science with reasonably good grades (CGPA of 3.9). But to be honest those grades obtained benefited from the COVID lockdown where my institution decided to assess us through assignments.  


I have just transferred to another more reputable university overseas to complete my second and final year. There has been a huge giant step in terms of the difficulty of the course. I am having trouble catching up with the lectures and having a hard time completing my exercises. This made me question my decision to jump into computer science as this wasn't a field that I was interested in, to begin with.  


I feel that I am stuck at a dead end and this has taken a toll on my mental well-being. I have a choice of dropping out from this university and then pursuing another course that I am more interested such as Finance or continuing my course back at my previous university as it was ""easier"" to get through there.  


Any opinions here?  


Thanks in advance :)",Need some advice about my current course.,"I finished my foundation year and my first year of computer science with reasonably good grades (CGPA of 3.9). But to be honest those grades obtained benefited from the COVID lockdown where my institution decided to assess us through assignments.  


I have just transferred to another more reputable university overseas to complete my second and final year. There has been a huge giant step in terms of the difficulty of the course. I am having trouble catching up with the lectures and having a hard time completing my exercises. This made me question my decision to jump into computer science as this wasn't a field that I was interested in, to begin with.

My friend who's not on reddit is having a hard time deciding his internship for Summer 2023, could I have your advice? 

Facts about him:

* Has previous fullstack SWE experience in F500 companies, big League gamer 
* Emphasis on learning, interesting team &amp; work, and future opportunities 
* Doesn't care about internship TC, hence not putting the salaries  

Details

* Amazon (Vancouver) - Team TBD closer to internship 
* Duolingo (Pittsburgh) - Team TBD closer to internship  
* LinkedIn (Sunnyvale) - Notifications Recommendation Infrastructure (Java, Kafka, Samza) 
* Riot Games (Remote + 1 week in LA) - Core Gameplay/Engine (C++)  

If you could elaborate on why in the comments that'd be great!

csMajors,"Hello everyone,

I am a second year CS student currently taking Discrete Math along with some other CS courses and calc 3. 

I know that Discrete Math will be the class I will likely perform the worst in, even though I am planning to spend a few hours every day on this class until finals. We are learning about combinatorics and to be honest I am a little confused, but I think I can grasp certain topics within the chapter. To be honest though my main worry is writing proofs for exams and assignments. I have never been exposed to proof writing before this class, so this new logical way of thinking will take some getting used to for me. I feel like I get stuck on the proofs pretty quickly, and I really don’t want to just search the answer up. I also feel like sometimes Im in class and the professor writes the steps to prove a theorem in class, and I think, “how did he know to go from step A to B? I would have never ever thought of that.” 

I am planning to try to do hopefully some practice every evening, writing a few proofs or at least trying to tackle them. Any advice is welcome, I really don’t want to take it again next semester with a prof who is infamous for being extremely difficult and failing many students.

csMajors,"CS is my third major. It is the one I wanted to do originally, but I thought I was too dumb. Now I have transferred to a cheaper school with a good CS program that I can commute to since I will be graduating late. My favorite class currently is data structures and I love the professor. I love my computer organization + assembly class as well, also taught by a great professor. I am taking an SQL class which is a lot harder than I thought, but overall it feels great to solve problems whether it be circuitry, assembly, C++, or SQL (my other classes are not very difficult or noteworthy)

Still. I had an internship over the summer and I hated it. You would think I would have enjoyed it so much. I was making $15 an hour, working for a respected on the rise company, it was remote. The thing is I just hated it so much. I was isolated from the other interns doing web development. I was using JS, angularjs (not angular, literally angularJS), C#, html, CSS. In theory I should have enjoyed it so much. The thing is the vibes were terrible despite everyone being very nice. I did not put forth the greatest effort as I did not really enjoy the work I was doing. For some reason angularJS was very hard for me to figure out. To give credit to myself they said I exceeded expectations and invited me back, but I declined.

My favorite part was probably making a working email form.

After my internship I dread the future. I can't imagine having to deal with clients, having to be on tight deadlines, having a manger and dev team to constantly report to. I don't know what I would do if I can't figure something out. I want my job to be stress-free

That being said, I guess this is more of a rant post, but has anyone shared similar feelings? Loving their classes, but hating the future? If I had a choice I would do something relating to CS and fish, as I am an aquarist and I love doing that. Is there a pathway for mixing CS and research of nature? Specifically of the aquatic kind?

csMajors,"Probably doesn't matter much but I was wondering what everyone's thoughts are on project names, and what do you do?

Do you title your projects basically what they are? Or do you try and give them unique names like Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, etc.? Do you think or have you heard of resume reviewers caring about this at all?

For example: a project that has a GUI application and lets users chat with each other over a network and can support port forwarding. Would you simply name it 'Network Chat Application' or something a bit less blatant and catchy like 'SocketTalk'?

I’m currently in the beginning of my computer science classes, and one of my current classes is a cybersecurity 101 class and requires basic knowledge in UNIX/LINUX systems and I have zero knowledge about that subject at all. 
For context, I had to to drop a class and add a new one in order to fulfill the requirement of having full time credit hours. I asked my advisor what class I should take after giving him my schedule, and he recommended
this cybersecurity class and said while it doesn’t count towards my major it is a good subject to learn about and will fulfill all my needs. So I enrolled in the class. I was not able to find out I needed to know about UNIX/LINUX systems until the class started because the UNIX class isn’t set as an actual prerequisite for the class even though it seems like I need to know it. I can’t drop the class and get a W and also lose financial aid so that is not an option. Below I will give an example of a question so you can gauge what I’m dealing with.

Just starting my comp sci degree. Advisor scheduled a class that I need to know some level of UNIX to solve some problems without telling me I needed to. Can’t drop the class, will lose money and fail. Where can I start to at least learn the bare minimum to be in this class?

So I am a first year student, but I am not a total beginner in college. Idk if its important on how to rewrite a resume or application but I have 5 years of experience as an army medic and 2 years of experience working as a nurse (LVN) prior to switching career paths and trying to become a developer. 

Overall, I get little support from my school programs and professors, so I want to be proactive about my future. My programming course has taught me the very basics in C++ such as functions, loops, branches, and arrays/vectors. It's all been coming to me fairly quickly and I can usually solve labs in class without too many problems. (though I use internet resources to get ideas of how to solve problems) 

I'm unsure how to translate these skills into something that I can put on a resume or how to even begin to start the process of bettering myself. All the labs that I have done are through an imbedded coding tool via ZyBooks, so I feel like I don't really quite know where to go from here.

csMajors,"I am an American-Israel dual citizen. I grew up my first 10 years of my life in America before moving to Israel. When I graduated high school, without going into to much detail, I joined a pretty reputable signal intelligence unit in the IDF that involved a lot of IT and programming skills for 3 years. 

I am now on the verge of leaving, and I have an offer to work as a Security Consultant at one of the top cybersecurity companies in Israel, in addition to several offers at other firms (one is FAANG, but it isn't an SWE role, more like an IT-related security role). 

My main issue with these roles, though, is that they aren't directly related to what I want to do. I want to be a software engineer - most of these roles, while still technical, are definitely closer to the IT/IT-security side than the actual programming and software development side.

At the same time, I am applying to several different universities in both Israel and the United States. With my test scores + grades in high school + military service in the IDF (not to mention the fact that I'm not an international student as I am a US citizen), I am confident that I can get into pretty good universities in computer science in both countries.

So, my question is, what kind of career path should I take. I see three options:

1) Forget college. Go directly into the work force as a security consultant.

2) Forget work. Go directly into college - either in Israel or America.

3) A combination of both - my friends suggested I work as a Security Consultant for a few years before going to college.

csMajors,"Okay Im aware that I sound dumb here but please hear me out. 

Some background: 
I go to a school with a 12 month coop program and this extends my degree by one year. So I'm in third year but I'm class of 2025.  Because I've already registered a coop in January, I literally could not graduate earlier than May 2025. 

What happened:

A recruiter messaged me on LinkedIn about a job with Microsoft, it's EXPLORE intern position. Now, I had never heard of it and she said it was a cool opportunity to explore both SWE and PM and for people graduating from 2025 to 2026. I messaged one person from my school on LinkedIn and she said that most interns come back as either regular SWE or PM the summer after and I assumed that's why they care about grad date. I was excited because I love the idea and applied. I entered all my info truthfully, that I started school in 2020 and will graduate in 2025 and was able to pass both rounds and get an offer. Yay! 

But here's the thing, after I joined the msft discord I realized that most people there don't understand the idea of coop (it's not a gap year, I would be registered as a full time student) because it's a Canadian thing? And they told me that I should be wary because they are doing a background check and may think I was dishonest because I'm not a second year student. I should state that I literally spoke 1:1 with a (FB) recruiter and told them I'm in third year BUT graduating in 2025 and he later recommended Facebook university to me bc he just cares about grad date. Also my school would verify my expected grad date as 2025. I always state 2025 because most companies want to know when you can come back as a full time new grad, so it's an honest answer. So I made some assumptions but yeah, the idiocy was not clarifying sooner (tbh I didn't think I'd even get to the first round) 


Now I feel like an idiot and I am very strongly thinking of messaging my recruiter explaining this situation because the last thing I want is to fail a background check in like March and then have no summer coop. I do not wish to be dishonest, but I also genuinely thought that if a recruiter is in my DMs and I never lied on my application or during my interview (there are Literally 2 summer internships on my resume that I spoke about at length???) that I should be ok. I have no worries about the rest of my background check, my GPA and all jobs are real and paid positions. 

Basically I'm pretty bummed but if I'm going to get the offer rescinded I'd rather know now so I can accept other roles. 

What would y'all do? I know I'm in a unique situation but I feel like I made a mistake at *least* by not clarifying earlier. I swear I've been so overwhelmed with applying to over 200 jobs, 20+ interviews this past month, 6 classes and a part time job. I genuinely didn't think too much about it.

csMajors,"To get right to the point: in technical interviews, there is so much more to them than knowing how to solve the leetcode-style questions they inevitably ask you. In fact, I might argue that your general attitude and vibes you give off with the interviewer are more important. Being specific: I just completed two final-round technical interviews with Microsoft this past Monday. I won't specify the questions I got (that would make my entire argument here pointless), but there were \~10 high-level technical questions in the first one, and then 20 mins at the end to do an LC medium. I didn't solve the question or optimize my solution. Next interview, BAM, 5 OOP questions I literally knew nothing about. But I was candid about being clueless and we both were laughing and vibing about it. Then he asked the LC Medium final question, which I literally blanked on. Legit, he held my hand through 20 mins of stumbling through the code. I immediately was like, I'm fucked. I should've prepped more. I see people on this sub saying the interviews are easy but hard for me. I'm incompetent. The works. But I kept my cool, and after our allotted time, we talked for 15 mins about what we both enjoy about being in an office and the interactions that come with it, as well as why he likes Microsoft, etc. I left the interview feeling awful in that I failed it, but good in that I vibed with the interviewer. I ended up getting accepted yesterday, and I was genuinely shocked. Not here to brag at all, but if I didn't get it, my entire argument would be false anyhow. My entire point is, relax, you won't be able to memorize the 2,000+ LC problems, or know all the patterns for every data structure perfectly, you just won't. And even if you do, it's not about just knocking the problem out of the park. Connecting with the interviewer is super important, and as I learned, more important, than solving the technicals correctly.

csMajors,"I’m a senior in high school. Please don’t give me that sugarcoated “you’re still young and have so much time!!!” kind of thing, I want answers. 

I took the AP Computer Science Principles class two years ago and it was one of the most boring things I’ve experienced. I received a 5 on the exam, but it is considered one of the easier ones. Initially, I was inclined towards CS for one thing; that six figure salary. 

Now, I’m stuck. I don’t know what to pursue.  I have until November 1st to choose my major for college. I haven’t found interest in anything except for music (or creative things in general; video editing, etc.), but a music (or other art) degree doesn’t put food on the table unless I become a teacher. So if absolutely nothing I could possibly study will interest me, should I just pursue CS for the money?",Do I have a future in CS if I have absolutely zero passion for it?,"I’m a senior in high school.

csMajors,"This is going to be a long post. Pouring my heart out here and venting.

First of all, majority of people, especially in this recruiting cycle would kill to be in my position. I understand that. I'm grateful for all the luck and opportunities I have received.

Onto the rant. I was able to land the SDE internship (not propel) at the rainforest as a freshman (i'm now a sophomore) from a no-name university. When I got the offer, I expected that I would use it to land a ""better"" internship. The word ""better"" is obviously subjective, but you get the idea. In my mind, I would leverage this as a freshman to its full potential. The ideal path that I pictured was rainforest -&gt; Google/Netflix -&gt; HFT of some sort. 

**Denial**

Fun story of how I even applied to rainforest. I was told that I stand no chance as a freshman, I was rejected from all the freshmen specific programs so, I decided to get at least an unpaid internship. Applied to around \~20 on angel list, got a message to schedule an interview; I took it. Day of the interview comes, no show from interviewer. I'm sitting there, in the room, fucking speechless, no other way to describe it. So, I said fuck it, went on Indeed, and started browsing internships. On around the 2nd page, I saw rainforest; I applied. And around a week later, at the dentist office, I received the email for the OA. You have no idea how hyped I was. It's indescribable. For the next \~2 months, non-stop, I was grinding leetcode. Got to the interview, passed it.

**Anger** 

It was around December, so I stopped grinding leetcode completely. I expected that I'd pick it back up closer to the recruiting season in April/May. And I didn't. I tried to do it while I was doing the internship, couldn't do it. I had immense guilt for wasting so much time. Even though I did well at the internship and got the return offer.

 **Bargaining** 

End of October, still not much leetcode progress. Majority of people outside of this sub would totally be cool with it. Majority of people in this sub would probably not be. Do I care? Not really. Maybe I just adapted the same mentality. I can see myself achieving much greater things, like the plan described in the beginning. Is rainforest bad? No. $10k a month for an intern? Fully remote? Amazing team? Sign me up. 

**Depression** 

What's the point of this post? It's just me feeling guilty about my choices. I do well in classes, go to the gym, play soccer, and video games. Do I enjoy doing those things? Yes. Do I feel insane guilt every day because I have more potential that I'm not realizing? Also, yes. I spend too much time on video games; or so I think. In reality though, I'm in good shape, with good grades, and have a good social circle. Maybe I'm just trying to convince myself. I don't know.  

I understand that I have a shit load of time before the next recruiting cycle. And I hope it will be a lot better than this one. I understand that I don't have to grind leetcode like a maniac every day, just 1 hour a day is enough. I could replace 1 hour of video games with leetcode, but I just don't. I'm 19 years old ffs. Why can't I do what I think I should do? Some day I feel motivated and promise myself that I will stay consistent. Some days, like today, I just feel like a bitch. 

I rationalize by saying that I have a great team, great pay, great conditions for work. But the immense guilt of spending free time just eats me from the outside like something else.

My naive solution was to have an array of created rectangles, then check if the current rectangle fits in all of them. Of course, this solution was met with TLE. 

Optimization I thought of what that we only need to keep track of two created rectangles: one with the minimum length seen so far and one with the minimum width seen so far. We compare the current rectangle with these two rectangles only.

However, still failed some hidden test cases, so I am wondering why my solution is faulty / what the optimal solution to this question actually is.",CodeSignal hidden test cases,"Hey all,
